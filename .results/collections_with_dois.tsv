Eickhoff					We investigated the neural correlates of action observation and imitation in the human brain, based on 139 functional imaging studies. For both types of task, bilateral networks were found. These did not only involve classic mirror neuron areas such as inferior frontal and inferior parietal cortex, but also dorsal premotor, superior parietal, posterior superior temporal and extrastriate visual areas. Additional analyses revealed the influence of effector used during the action, the instruction given to the subjects, and the involvement of objects during the action.

Eickhoff					This study shows that the right DLPFC as observed in 4 different experiments of executive action control may be subdivided into 2 distinct subregions -- an anterior-ventral and a posterior-dorsal one -- based on their whole-brain co-activation patterns across neuroimaging studies. The posterior subregion showed increased connectivity with bilateral intraparietal sulci, whereas the anterior subregion showed increased connectivity with the anterior cingulate cortex. Functional characterization revealed the anterior network to be more strongly associated with attention and action inhibition processes, whereas the posterior network was more strongly related to action execution and working memory.

Eickhoff					We investigated whether the functional heterogeneity of Broca's region is reflected in distinct modules within cytoarchitectonically-defined left area 44 using meta-analytic connectivity-based parcellation (CBP). Our analysis revealed five separate clusters within left area 44. A post-hoc functional characterization and functional connectivity analysis of these five clusters was then performed, revealing specific and distinct functional characteristics and connectivity patterns. The results demonstrate that left area 44 is heterogeneous, thus supporting anatomical data on the molecular architecture of this region, and provide a basis for more specific interpretations of activations localized in area 44.

Smeets				mni	Despite their intentions, weight-concerned individuals generally fail to control their eating behavior. However, it is unknown whether this failure is due to a lack of effortful self-control, or to not experiencing an internal conflict between weight goals and food temptations. The present study used fMRI, eye tracking and reaction times to assess the degree of conflict experienced by weight-concerned women during food choices that posed either a self-control dilemma (i.e., requiring a choice between healthy and palatable foods), or not. Contrary to the common assumption in self-control theory that food choices posing a self-control dilemma evoke internal conflict, we found that choices requiring self-control induced no conflict, as demonstrated by lower reaction times, fixation durations, number of gaze switches between snacks, and lower activation of the anterior cingulate cortex. Our results suggest that self-control failure might be due to a lack of experienced conflict, rather than to failing to act upon the perception of such conflict. This implies that effectiveness of weight maintenance interventions might be improved if they also focus on increasing the ability to detect a self-control dilemma, in addition to the current focus on increasing self-regulatory capacity.	2015-09-15T07:48:24.473327Z	3.8		3.0	70.0		True		False		REML	randommixedeffects		Factorial design: one sample t-test		False		right	CAnonical	128 s	724	Inclusion criteria: a restraint-score above average or high, age between 18 and 30 years, being right-handed, having a normal weight.

To this end, a quantitative meta-analysis of pertinent neuroimaging studies was performed, identifying a set of mainly right-lateralized brain regions that may form the core network subserving vigilant attention in humans. This network included dorsomedial, mid- and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior insula, parietal areas (intraparietal sulcus, temporoparietal junction), and subcortical structures (cerebellar vermis, thalamus, putamen, midbrain).

Forstmann and Jane Neumann					We conducted an Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analysis on the existing neuroimaging literature on perceptual decision making. The results argue in favor of the involvement of a frontal-parietal network in general perceptual decision-making that is possibly complemented by the basal ganglia, and modulated in substantial parts by task difficulty. In contrast, expectation of reward, an important aspect of many decision-making processes, shows almost no overlap with the general perceptual decision-making network.

Vinski, Jonathan W. Schooler and Daniel S. Margulies					Reading is a fundamental human capacity and yet it can easily be derailed by the simple act of mind-wandering. A large-scale brain network, referred to as the default mode network (DMN), has been shown to be involved in both mind-wandering and reading, raising the question as to how the same neural system could be implicated in processes with both costs and benefits to narrative comprehension. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was used to explore whether the intrinsic functional connectivity of the two key midline hubs of the DMN — the posterior cingulate (PCC) and anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC) — was predictive of individual differences in reading comprehension and task focus recorded outside of the scanner. Worse comprehension was associated with greater functional connectivity between the PCC and a region of the ventral striatum. By contrast reports of increasing task focus were associated with functional connectivity from the aMPFC to clusters in the PCC, the left parietal and temporal cortex, and the cerebellum. Our results suggest that the DMN has both costs (such as poor comprehension) and benefits to reading (such as an on-task focus) because its midline core can couple its activity with other regions to form distinct functional communities that allow seemingly opposing mental states to occur. This flexible coupling allows the DMN to participate in cognitive states that complement the act of reading as well as others that do not.	2013-10-01T08:28:02.669405Z																				18								Frontiers in Human Neuroscience					2015-12-23T11:00:50.040383Z					The default modes of reading: modulation of posterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex connectivity associated with comprehension and task focus while reading												33	JonathanSmallwood	http://www.frontiersin.org/Human_Neuroscience/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00734/abstract																							http://neurovault.org/collections/18/

A conjunction analysis across ALE meta-analyses delineating regions consistently recruited by reorienting of attention and false belief studies revealed the anterior rTPJ, suggesting an overarching role of this specific region. An anatomical difference analysis revealed the posterior rTPJ as converging more with false belief than with reorienting of attention tasks. Additional meta-analytic connectivity mapping (MACM) and resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analyses showed that the posterior rTPJ has connectivity patterns with typical ToM (Theory of Mind) regions, whereas the anterior part of rTPJ co-activates with the attentional network.

Based on the voxel-based morphometry meta-analysis of 193 studies comprising 15 892 individuals across 6 diverse diagnostic groups (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, addiction, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and anxiety), we found that gray matter loss converged across diagnoses in 3 regions: the dorsal anterior cingulate, right insula, and left insula. By contrast, there were few diagnosis-specific effects, distinguishing only schizophrenia and depression from other diagnoses. In the parallel follow-up analyses of 3 healthy cohorts, we found that the common gray matter loss regions formed a tightly interconnected network during tasks and at resting and that lower gray matter in this network was associated with poor executive functioning.

According to our model, the superior temporal gyrus, angular gyrus and (pre) supplementary motor area should be involved in execution of regulation initiated by frontal areas. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may be related to regulation of cognitive processes such as attention, while the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex may not necessarily reflect the regulatory process per se, but signals salience and therefore the need to regulate.

Endestad					The striking homogeneity of cerebellar microanatomy is strongly suggestive of a corresponding uniformity of function. Consequently, theoretical models of the cerebellum's role in motor control should offer important clues regarding cerebellar contributions to cognition. One such influential theory holds that the cerebellum encodes internal models, neural representations of the context-specific dynamic properties of an object, to facilitate predictive control when manipulating the object. The present study examined whether this theoretical construct can shed light on the contribution of the cerebellum to language processing. We reasoned that the cerebellum might perform a similar coordinative function when the context provided by the initial part of a sentence can be highly predictive of the end of the sentence. Using functional MRI in humans we tested two predictions derived from this hypothesis, building on previous neuroimaging studies of internal models in motor control. First, focal cerebellar activation–reflecting the operation of acquired internal models–should be enhanced when the linguistic context leads terminal words to be predictable. Second, more widespread activation should be observed when such predictions are violated, reflecting the processing of error signals that can be used to update internal models. Both predictions were confirmed, with predictability and prediction violations associated with increased blood oxygenation level-dependent signal in the posterior cerebellum (Crus I/II). Our results provide further evidence for cerebellar involvement in predictive language processing and suggest that the notion of cerebellar internal models may be extended to the language domain.	2014-01-02T20:51:32.544866Z																				25								Journal of Neuroscience					2015-12-23T11:00:52.370642Z					Generalized Role for the Cerebellum in Encoding Internal Models: Evidence from Semantic Processing					32.0							40	tmoberget	http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/doi/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2264-13.2014																						eventrelated	http://neurovault.org/collections/25/

Ivry and Tor Endestad					Functional neuroimaging studies consistently report language-related cerebellar activations, but evidence from the clinical literature is less conclusive. Here, we attempt to bridge this gap by testing the effect of focal cerebellar lesions on cerebral activations in a reading task previously shown to involve distinct cerebellar regions. In a previous fMRI-study of healthy young adults, we observed increased activation in the posterior cerebellum when the final word of a sentence was predictable, compared to when the final word was unpredictable; this effect was especially strong when the prediction was violated. In addition, an experimental contrast designed to function as a basic language localizer revealed activations in more medial cerebellar regions. All contrasts also yielded distributed cerebral activations. In the current study, patients (N=10) had lesions primarily affecting midline cerebellar structures, overlapping cerebellar activations previously seen for basic language processing, but distinct from prediction-related activations. In line with this pattern of cerebellar activation-lesion overlap, the patients did not differ from matched healthy controls (N=10) in cerebral activations related to prediction generation or prediction error processing. However, they exhibited a different cerebral activation pattern related to general language processing. Whereas controls showed increased activation in bilateral auditory cortex and parietal operculum when silently reading familiar words relative to viewing meaningless and unpronounceable letter strings, this effect was absent in the patients. Our results highlight the need for careful lesion mapping when investigating functional consequences of cerebellar pathology and suggest possible roles for the cerebellum in visual-to-auditory mapping and/or inner speech.	2015-10-30T00:18:50.339407Z																				160								Brain and Language					2015-12-23T11:01:20.005856Z					Patients with focal cerebellar lesions show reduced auditory cortex activation during silent reading												40	tmoberget	http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0093934X15001753																							http://neurovault.org/collections/160/

We estimated connectivity using three separate approaches: resting-state BOLD covariance, structural covariance based on cortical thickness, and meta-analytic connectivity modelling (MACM). We found a distinct overlap of all measures, more strongly for aLPFC, with working memory networks defined in a previous study, and a contrast between resting state aLPFC and pLPFC activation that is consistent with the idea of a hierarchical organization of frontoparietal networks. We also found significant anti-correlations of these seed region, with aLPFC but not pLPFC showing a substantial overlap with networks previously associated with social and emotional processing.

Card-sorting performance correlated positively with GMV of the right anterior insula, FC between bilateral anterior insula and midcingulate cortex/supplementary motor area. GMV, FC and impulsivity together accounted for more variance of card-sorting performance than every parameter alone.

To further elucidate neural underpinnings of BPD, the present meta-analysis summarizes functional neuroimaging findings of emotion processing tasks as well as structural neuroimaging findings, and investigates multi-modally affected brain regions.Combined coordinate- and image-based meta-analyses were calculated using Anisotropic Effect Size Signed Differential Mapping. Nineteen functional neuroimaging studies investigating the processing of negative compared to neutral stimuli in a total of 281 patients with BPD and 293 healthy controls were included. In addition, ten nine studies investigating gray matter abnormalities in 263 256 patients with BPD and 278 272 healthy (HC) controls were analyzed. Compared to HC, BPD patients showed relatively increased activation of the left amygdala and posterior cingulate cortex, along with blunted responses of the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during the processing of negative emotional stimuli. The multi-modal analysis identified the left amygdala to be characterized by a combination of functional hyperactivity and smaller gray matter volume compared to HC. Hyperresponsivity of the amygdala was moderated by medication status of the patient samples. Medication-free samples were characterized by limbic hyperactivity, whereas no such group differences were found in patients currently taking psychotropic medication. Results strengthen the assumption that dysfunctional dorsolateral prefrontal and limbic brain regions are a hallmark feature of BPD, and therefore are consistent with the conceptualization of BPD as an emotion dysregulation disorder.

Neural responses, as reflected in hemodynamic changes, were measured in six subjects (five female and one male) with gradient echo echoplanar imaging on a GE 3T scanner (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI) [repetition time (TR) = 2500 ms, 40 3.5-mm-thick sagittal images, field of view (FOV) = 24 cm, echo time (TE) = 30 ms, flip angle = 90] while they performed a one-back repetition detection task. High-resolution T1-weighted spoiled gradient recall (SPGR) images were obtained for each subject to provide detailed anatomy (124 1.2-mm-thick sagittal images, FOV = 24 cm). Stimuli were gray-scale images of faces, houses, cats, bottles, scissors, shoes, chairs, and nonsense patterns. The categories were chosen so that all stimuli from a given category would have the same base level name. The specific categories were selected to allow comparison with our previous studies (faces, houses, chairs, animals, and tools) or ongoing studies (shoes and bottles). Control nonsense patterns were phase-scrambled images of the intact objects. Twelve time series were obtained in each subject. Each time series began and ended with 12 s of rest and contained eight stimulus blocks of 24-s duration, one for each category, separated by 12-s intervals of rest. Stimuli were presented for 500 ms with an interstimulus interval of 1500 ms. Repetitions of meaningful stimuli were pictures of the same face or object photographed from different angles. Stimuli for each meaningful category were four images each of 12 different exemplars."	2015-03-05T20:12:11.044067Z					https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000105															415								NeuroImage					2015-12-23T14:42:43.222043Z					Combinatorial codes in ventral temporal lobe for object recognition: Haxby (2001) revisited: is there a “face” area?					6.0							186	vsochat	http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S105381190400299X					2.5		GE	3T															http://neurovault.org/collections/415/

Coggan, Kirstie Wailes-Newson and Jonathan Smallwood			daniel.baker		Bistable stimuli, such as the Necker Cube, demonstrate that experience can change in the absence of changes in the environment. Such phenomena can be used to assess stimulus-independent aspects of conscious experience. The current study used resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to index stimulus-independent changes in neural activity to understand the neural architecture that determines dominance durations during bistable perception (using binocular rivalry and Necker cube stimuli). Anterior regions of the Superior Parietal Lobule (SPL) exhibited robust connectivity with regions of primary sensorimotor cortex. The strength of this region's connectivity with the striatum predicted shorter dominance durations during binocular rivalry, whereas its connectivity to pre-motor cortex predicted longer dominance durations for the Necker Cube. Posterior regions of the SPL, on the other hand, were coupled to associative cortex in the temporal and frontal lobes. The posterior SPL's connectivity to the temporal lobe predicted longer dominance during binocular rivalry. In conjunction with prior work, these data suggest that the anterior SPL contributes to perceptual rivalry through the inhibition of incongruent bottom up information, whereas the posterior SPL influences rivalry by supporting the current interpretation of a bistable stimulus. Our data suggests that the functional connectivity of the SPL with regions of sensory, motor, and associative cortex allows it to regulate the interpretation of the environment that forms the focus of conscious attention at a specific moment in time.	2015-08-06T08:49:19.524140Z	19.0	192.0	3.0	90.0	https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B5zqqbtBrnEHfmdzWkw2SlVNMkhtX0wwOEFsUUZqdU1IUUhFREU4c0xuNEhpR1d3aUt6MWc&usp=sharing			False												744								NeuroImage	420.0	420.0		64.0	2015-12-23T20:25:37.631475Z					Brain networks underlying bistable perception		1.0	1.0	5.0	26.0				interleaved			516	ddcoggan	http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1053811915005583					2000.0		General Electric	Signa Excite HDx		3.0												other	http://neurovault.org/collections/744/				True

Lieberman					Humans readily adopt an intentional stance to other people, comprehending their behavior as guided by unobservable mental states such as belief, desire, and intention. We used fMRI in healthy adults to test the hypothesis that this stance is primed by the default mode of human brain function present when the mind is at rest. We report three findings that support this hypothesis. First, brain regions activated by actively adopting an intentional rather than nonintentional stance to another person were anatomically similar to those demonstrating default responses to a fixation baseline condition. Second, moment-to-moment variation in default activity in the dorsomedial pFC was related to the ease with which participants applied an intentional-but not nonintentional-stance to a social stimulus presented moments later. Finally, individuals who showed stronger dorsomedial pFC activity at baseline in a separate task were generally more efficient when adopting the intentional stance and reported having greater social skills. These results identify a biological basis for the human tendency to adopt the intentional stance. More broadly, they suggest that the brain's default response may have evolved, in part, as a response to life in a social world.	2015-03-12T00:14:43.776034Z								False									right			446	All participants were native English speakers and were not taking psychotropic medications at the time of the study							Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience		590.0	4		2015-12-23T20:25:57.877993Z					The Default Mode of Human Brain Function Primes the Intentional Stance		3.0	2.0	0.0	21.0		True	https://github.com/spunt/easy-optimize-x				267	spunt	http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/jocn_a_00785		0.4762														31.0	22.86	18.0				eventrelated	http://neurovault.org/collections/446/

Dehaene			bthirion, gael.varoquaux		Linguistic analyses suggest that sentences are not mere strings of words but possess a hierarchical structure with constituents nested inside each other. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to search for the cerebral mechanisms of this theoretical construct. We hypothesized that the neural assembly that encodes a constituent grows with its size, which can be approximately indexed by the number of words it encompasses. We therefore searched for brain regions where activation increased parametrically with the size of linguistic constituents, in response to a visual stream always comprising 12 written words or pseudowords. The results isolated a network of left-hemispheric regions that could be dissociated into two major subsets. Inferior frontal and posterior temporal regions showed constituent size effects regardless of whether actual content words were present or were replaced by pseudowords (jabberwocky stimuli). This observation suggests that these areas operate autonomously of other language areas and can extract abstract syntactic frames based on function words and morphological information alone. On the other hand, regions in the temporal pole, anterior superior temporal sulcus and temporo-parietal junction showed constituent size effect only in the presence of lexico-semantic information, suggesting that they may encode semantic constituents. In several inferior frontal and superior temporal regions, activation was delayed in response to the largest constituent structures, suggesting that nested linguistic structures take increasingly longer time to be computed and that these delays can be measured with fMRI. 	2015-06-22T09:18:21.605851Z																				654								Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences					2015-12-23T20:24:16.369609Z					Cortical representation of the constituent structure of sentences												470	schwarty	http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1018711108																							http://neurovault.org/collections/654/

Eighteen patients with treated hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis (mean age 32, range 18-54 years; two males; mean treatment duration 4.4 years) and 18 healthy matched control subjects underwent 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Voxel-based morphometry was used to investigate grey matter density, resting-state functional MRI to analyse the brain connectivity of areas known to be altered in hypothyroidism and event-related functional MRI to examine brain activity during associative memory encoding. Neuropsychological assessment included memory, working memory, psychomotor speed and attention. We previously reported subclinically reduced mood in this study population and investigated its neural correlates here. Thyroid stimulating hormone, free triiodthyronine, free thyroxine and thyroid peroxidase antibodies were measured in serum. We did not find cognitive deficits or alterations in grey matter density, functional connectivity or associative memory-related brain activity in comparison to the control group and cognition was unrelated to thyroid serum measures in the patient group. Thyroid peroxidase antibodies in the patient group correlated with increased grey matter density in right amygdala and enhanced connectivity between subcallosal and parahippocampal areas. Treatment duration was associated with brain structure in frontal and occipital cortex and connectivity between left amygdala and frontal cortex. Mood correlated with brain areas associated with distinct functional networks, but not with those most prominently affected in depression. In conclusion, no cognitive or neural alterations were detected in this young and otherwise healthy cohort of patients in comparison to a healthy control group and current mood status could not be related to depression-related networks. However, autoimmune activity and treatment duration showed a relationship with depression and hypothyroidism-related brain structure and function. They are thus promising factors to further investigate residual complaints despite biochemically adequate treatment in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

Dehaene			bthirion, gael.varoquaux		Humans can understand spoken or written sentences presented at extremely fast rates of ∼400 wpm, far exceeding the normal speech rate (∼150 wpm). How does the brain cope with speeded language? And what processing bottlenecks eventually make language incomprehensible above a certain presentation rate? We used time-resolved fMRI to probe the brain responses to spoken and written sentences presented at five compression rates, ranging from intelligible (60–100% of the natural duration) to challenging (40%) and unintelligible (20%). The results show that cortical areas differ sharply in their activation speed and amplitude. In modality-specific sensory areas, activation varies linearly with stimulus duration. However, a large modality-independent left-hemispheric language network, including the inferior frontal gyrus (pars orbitalis and triangularis) and the superior temporal sulcus, shows a remarkably time-invariant response, followed by a sudden collapse for unintelligible stimuli. Finally, linear and nonlinear responses, reflecting a greater effort as compression increases, are seen at various prefrontal and parietal sites. We show that these profiles fit with a simple model according to which the higher stages of language processing operate at a fixed speed and thus impose a temporal bottleneck on sentence comprehension. At presentation rates faster than this internal processing speed, incoming words must be buffered, and intelligibility vanishes when buffer storage and retrieval operations are saturated. Based on their temporal and amplitude profiles, buffer regions can be identified with the left inferior frontal/anterior insula, precentral cortex, and mesial frontal cortex. 	2015-06-22T12:01:57.401977Z																				659								Journal of Neuroscience					2015-12-23T11:00:07.451832Z					A Temporal Bottleneck in the Language Comprehension Network												470	schwarty	http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/doi/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5685-11.2012																							http://neurovault.org/collections/659/

It describes an additional study group from the study described here, Quinque et al. 2014: doi 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2014.01.015

Patients were newly diagnosed with hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis. 11 patients were recruited between June 2011 and June 2013 via local endocrinologists and among blood donors and participants of a large cohort study (LIFE). One patient had to be excluded due to a benign brain anomaly, another for a lack of hypothyroidism at study entry. Nine healthy control subjects were selected from the control sample of Quinque et al. 2014 to match the patients in age, sex and intelligence.
Sample description: mean age/SD patients 42+/-5, controls 38+/-8; 8 females each; IQ patients 104+/-10, controls 107+/-8. Thyroid laboratory values: patients session 1: TSH 6.1+/-1, fT3 4.8+/-1, fT4 12.6+/-2, TPO 285+/- 184; patients session 2: TSH 3.4+/-1, fT3 4.6+/-1, fT4 15.7+/-2, TPO 287+/-184; controls session 1: TSH 2.9+/- 1, fT3 4.5+/-1, fT4 14.9+/- 1, TPO 11+/-2; controls session 2: TSH 2.5+/- 1, fT3 4.4+/-0.4, fT4 14.5+/- 1, TPO 9+/-3.
The scanning protocol was identical to the one reported in Quinque et al. 2014. Analysis was identical except that data was not averaged over the two timepoints.
Groups were compared at both sessions separately. In addition, paired t-tests were used to analyse changes over time in the patient group. Thirdly, the interaction between session and group was analysed in a 2x2 ANOVA design. All analyses were controlled for age and sex, VBM analyses additionally for total intracranial volume (TIV).
Resting-state fMRI was only available for 8 patients, because one patient panicked after the structural scan. One control subjects was equally removed from the analysis to ensure matching between the groups.
The task fMRI data was not analysed due to an unexpected performance difference even before treatment in the direction that the patients performed better.
Overall conclusion: We were not able to find any group differences or changes over time that would survive classical statistical thresholds at the level of whole brain analyses or regions of interest analyses, (six ROIS as in Quinque et al. 2014 were used). As the sample was small and the disease severity and treatment effect on thyroid laboratory values likewise, we cannot conclude whether the result is due to a lack of power or whether there really are no structural and functional brain changes. Therefore, we refrain from publication, but want to make the data available for metaanalyses to avoid publication bias towards positive findings from little powered studies.

Margulies and Julia Sacher					Serotonin functions as an essential neuromodulator that serves a multitude of roles, most prominently balancing mood [ 1 ]. Serotonergic challenge has been observed to reduce intrinsic functional connectivity in brain regions implicated in mood regulation [ 2–4 ]. However, the full scope of serotonergic action on functional connectivity in the human brain has not been explored. Here, we show evidence that a single dose of a serotonin reuptake inhibitor dramatically alters functional connectivity throughout the whole brain in healthy subjects (n = 22). Our network-centrality analysis reveals a widespread decrease in connectivity in most cortical and subcortical areas. In the cerebellum and thalamus, however, we find localized increases. These rapid and brain-encompassing connectivity changes linked to acute serotonin transporter blockade suggest a key role for the serotonin transporter in the modulation of the functional macroscale connectome.	2014-10-29T06:39:16.336198Z								True												190				linear				Current Biology					2015-12-23T11:01:21.823109Z					Serotonergic Modulation of Intrinsic Functional Connectivity				2.0	22.0							140	alexschaefer83	http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982214010379							Siemens															other	http://neurovault.org/collections/190/				True

Langers and Gert J. ter Horst				mni	These images contain the contrast images and response maps provided in the paper. Abstract: The primary gustatory area is located in the insular cortex. Although the insular cortex has been the topic of multiple parcellation studies, its functional specialization regarding taste processing received relatively little attention. Studies investigating the brain response to taste suggested that the insular cortex is involved in processing multiple characteristics of a taste stimulus, such as its quality, intensity, and pleasantness. In the current functional magnetic resonance study, younger and older adult male subjects were exposed to four basic tastes in five increasing concentrations. We applied a data-driven analysis to obtain insular response maps, which showed that the insular cortex processes the presence of taste, its corresponding pleasantness, as well as its concentration. More specifically, the left and right insular cortices are differentially engaged in processing the aforementioned taste characteristics: representations of the presence of a taste stimulus as well as its corresponding pleasantness dominate in the left insular cortex, whereas taste concentration processing dominates in the right insular cortex. These results were similar across both age groups. Our results fit well within previous cytoarchitectural studies and show insular lateralization in processing different aspects of taste stimuli in men. 	2015-08-11T12:21:36.391331Z	30.0		3.0	7.0		True	SPM8 native	False	Combination of healthy young and older male participants.		fixedeffects		regression	SPM8 native			right	HRF	128	754	No history of taste, smell, neurological, or psychological disorders.

Adolphs					People typically explain others’ behaviors by attributing them to the beliefs and motives of an unobservable mind. Although such attributional inferences are critical for understanding the social world, it is unclear whether they rely on processes distinct from those used to understand the nonsocial world. In the present study, we used functional MRI to identify brain regions associated with making attributions about social and nonsocial situations. Attributions in both domains activated a common set of brain regions, and individual differences in the domain-specific recruitment of one of these regions—the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC)—correlated with attributional accuracy in each domain. Overall, however, the DMPFC showed greater activation for attributions about social than about nonsocial situations, and this selective response to the social domain was greatest in participants who reported the highest levels of social expertise. We conclude that folk explanations of behavior are an expert use of a domain-general cognitive ability.	2014-12-30T22:01:51.174588Z								False									right			297	neurologically and psychiatrically healthy, had normal or corrected-tonormal vision, spoke English fluently, had an IQ in the normal range							Psychological Science					2015-12-23T11:03:20.085190Z					Folk Explanations of Behavior: A Specialized Use of a Domain-General Mechanism				2.0	19.0							267	spunt	http://pss.sagepub.com/lookup/doi/10.1177/0956797615569002		0.3														46.0	28.32	21.0					http://neurovault.org/collections/297/

Eickhoff					We here employed methods for large-scale data mining to perform a connectivity-derived parcellation of the human amygdala based on whole-brain coactivation patterns computed for each seed voxel. Using this approach, connectivity-based parcellation divided the amygdala into three distinct clusters that are highly consistent with earlier microstructural distinctions. Meta-analytic connectivity modelling and functional characterization further revealed that the amygdala's laterobasal nuclei group was associated with coordinating high-level sensory input, whereas its centromedial nuclei group was linked to mediating attentional, vegetative, and motor responses. The results of this model-free approach support the concordance of structural, connectional, and functional organization in the human amygdala.

Eickhoff					In this study, we established a robust mapping of the social-affective default mode network (DMN) and those strongly connected to them (the extended social-affective default network). We performed meta-analytic connectivity modeling and resting-state analyses in the meta-analytically defined DMN regions, and obtained a a conjunction across both connectivity analyses. We then functionally characterized the ensuing regions and performed several cluster analyses. The current work highlights a robustly interconnected network that may be central to introspective, socio-affective, that is, self- and other-related mental processes.

The body underlies our sense of self, emotion, and agency. Signals arising from the skin convey warmth, social touch, and the physical characteristics of external stimuli. Surprising or unexpected tactile sensations can herald events of motivational salience, including imminent threats (e.g., an insect bite) and hedonic rewards (a caressing touch). Awareness of such events is thought to depend upon the hierarchical integration of body-related mismatch responses by the anterior insula. To investigate this possibility, we measured brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging, while healthy participants performed a roving tactile oddball task. Mass-univariate analysis demonstrated robust activations in limbic, somatosensory, and prefrontal cortical areas previously implicated in tactile deviancy, body awareness, and cognitive control. Dynamic Causal Modelling revealed that unexpected stimuli increased the strength of forward connections along a caudal to rostral hierarchy—projecting from thalamic and somatosensory regions towards insula, cingulate and prefrontal cortices. Within this ascending flow of sensory information, the AIC was the only region to show increased backwards connectivity to the somatosensory cortex, augmenting a reciprocal exchange of neuronal signals. Further, participants who rated stimulus changes as easier to detect showed stronger modulation of descending PFC to AIC connections by deviance. These results suggest that the AIC coordinates hierarchical processing of tactile prediction error. They are interpreted in support of an embodied predictive coding model where AIC mediated body awareness is involved in anchoring a global neuronal workspace.

Fox, Karl Zilles and Simon B. Eickhoff					We conducted multi-modal connectivity-based parcellation to investigate potentially separate functional modules within right temporoparietal junction (RTPJ). Both task-constrained meta-analytic coactivation mapping and task-free resting-state connectivity analysis independently identified two distinct clusters within RTPJ. Coactivation mapping and resting-state correlations revealed that the anterior cluster increased neural activity concomitantly with a midcingulate-motor-insular network, functionally associated with attention, and decreased neural activity concomitantly with a parietal network, functionally associated with social cognition and memory retrieval, while the posterior cluster showed the exact opposite association pattern.

Hensel					In this study, the functional heterogeneity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) was investigated identifying four subregions (rostroventral, rostrodorsal, caudal-right, and caudal-left). Both rostral clusters were functionally connected to the amygdala and hippocampus and associated with mnemonic and social cognitive tasks. The rostroventral cluster exhibited strongest connectivity to the default mode network. Unlike the rostral differentiation, the caudal dmPFC was divided by hemispheres. The caudal-right cluster was strongly connected to a frontoparietal network (dorsal attention network), whereas the caudal-left cluster was strongly connected to the anterior midcingulate cortex and bilateral anterior insula (salience network).

Eickhoff					We used activation likelihood estimation (ALE) with all available and suitable PET and fMRI studies employing a vestibular stimulus. Most consistently across 28 experiments vestibular stimuli evoked activity in the right hemispheric parietal opercular area OP 2 implicating it as the core region for vestibular processing. A subsequent functional connectivity analysis, using these result as a seeding point, confirmed direct connections of OP 2 with every other region found in the meta-analysis, in particular temporo-parietal regions, premotor cortex, and the midcingulate gyrus. We conclude that the cytoarchitectonic area OP 2 in the parietal operculum, embedded in a joint vestibular network, should be the primary candidate for the human vestibular cortex.

Paper abstract: 
Valuation is a key tenet of decision neuroscience, where it is generally assumed that different attributes of competing options are assimilated into unitary values. Such values are central to current neural models of choice. By contrast, psychological studies emphasize complex interactions between choice and valuation. Principles of neuronal selection also suggest that competitive inhibition may occur in early valuation stages, before option selection. We found that behavior in multi-attribute choice is best explained by a model involving competition at multiple levels of representation. This hierarchical model also explains neural signals in human brain regions previously linked to valuation, including striatum, parietal and prefrontal cortex, where activity represents within-attribute competition, competition between attributes and option selection. This multi-layered inhibition framework challenges the assumption that option values are computed before choice.

All subjects were skillful touch typists and performed five tasks: a typing task, a writing task, a reading task, and two control tasks. Three brain regions were activated during both the typing and the writing tasks: the left superior parietal lobule, the left supramarginal gyrus, and the left premotor cortex close to Exner’s area. Although typing and writing involved common brain regions, direct comparison between the typing and the writing task revealed greater left posteromedial intraparietal cortex activation in the typing task. In addition, activity in the left premotor cortex was more rostral in the typing task than in the writing task. These findings suggest that, although the brain circuits involved in Japanese typewriting are almost the same as those involved in handwriting, there are brain regions that are specific for typewriting.	2015-12-30T05:06:02.470846Z	30.0	240.0	3.0	90.0				False			randommixedeffects						right			1051	Right-handed healthy volunteers who could touch type, and were native Japanese speakers with no history of neurological or learning disorderes.

Twenty-seven non-demented Parkinson's patients (mean disease duration: 5years, mean score on the Hoehn & Yahr scale=1.5) were compared with 26 elderly controls matched for age, sex, and education level. Track density images were created by sampling each subject's spatially normalized fiber tracks in 1mm isotropic intervals and counting the fibers that passed through each voxel. Whole-brain voxel-based analysis was performed and significance was assessed with permutation testing. Statistically significant increases in track density were found in the Parkinson's patients, relative to controls. Clusters were distributed in disease-relevant areas including motor, cognitive, and limbic networks. From the lower medulla to the diencephalon and striatum, clusters encompassed the known location of the locus coeruleus and pedunculopontine nucleus in the pons, and from the substantia nigra up to medial aspects of the posterior putamen, bilaterally. The results identified in brainstem and nigrostriatal pathways show a large overlap with the known distribution of neuropathological changes in non-demented PD patients.

Spunt and Ralph Adolphs					The ability to impute mental states to others, or Theory of Mind (ToM), has been the subject of hundreds of neuroimaging studies. Although reviews and meta-analyses of these studies have concluded that ToM recruits a coherent brain network, mounting evidence suggests that this network is an abstraction based on pooling data from numerous studies, most of which use different behavioral tasks to investigate ToM. Problematically, this means that no single behavioral task can be used to reliably measure ToM Network function as currently conceived. To make ToM Network function scientifically tractable, we need standardized tasks capable of reliably measuring specific aspects of its functioning. Here, our goal is to validate the Why/How Task for this purpose. Several prior studies have found that when compared to answering how-questions about another person's behavior, answering why-questions about that same behavior activates a network that is anatomically consistent with meta-analytic definitions of the ToM Network. In the version of the Why/How Task presented here, participants answer yes/no Why (e.g., Is the person helping someone?) and How (e.g., Is the person lifting something?) questions about pretested photographs of naturalistic human behaviors. Across three fMRI studies, we show that the task elicits reliable performance measurements and modulates a left-lateralized network that is consistently localized across studies. While this network is convergent with meta-analyses of ToM studies, it is largely distinct from the network identified by the widely used False-Belief Localizer, the most common ToM task. Our new task is publicly available, and can be used as an efficient functional localizer to provide reliable identification of single-subject responses in most regions of the network. Our results validate the Why/How Task, both as a standardized protocol capable of producing maximally comparable data across studies, and as a flexible foundation for programmatic research on the neurobiological foundations of a basic manifestation of human ToM.	2015-03-11T19:00:17.646736Z																				445								NeuroImage					2015-12-23T11:01:43.594265Z					Validating the Why/How contrast for functional MRI studies of Theory of Mind												267	spunt	http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1053811914003887																							http://neurovault.org/collections/445/

Although prefrontal cortex has been implicated in the cognitive regulation of emotion, the cortical-subcortical interactions that mediate this ability remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we identified a right ventrolateral prefrontal region (vlPFC) whose activity correlated with reduced negative emotional experience during cognitive reappraisal of aversive images. We then applied a pathway-mapping analysis on subcortical regions to locate mediators of the association between vlPFC activity and reappraisal success (i.e., reductions in reported emotion). Results identified two separable pathways that together explained approximately 50% of the reported variance in self-reported emotion: (1) a path through nucleus accumbens that predicted greater reappraisal success, and (2) a path through ventral amygdala that predicted reduced reappraisal success (i.e., more negative emotion). These results provide direct evidence that vlPFC is involved in both the generation and regulation of emotion through different subcortical pathways, suggesting a general role for this region in appraisal processes.	2015-03-06T01:22:46.836271Z			1.5		https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000108															425								Neuron					2016-01-01T05:40:42.810142Z					Prefrontal-Subcortical Pathways Mediating Successful Emotion Regulation					34.0							186	vsochat	http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0896627308007538		0.5					GE	Signa Twin Speed Excite HD scanner								41.0	22.18	18.0					http://neurovault.org/collections/425/

We tested the hypothesis that cortical circuits for spatial attention contribute to mental arithmetic in humans. We trained a multivariate classifier algorithm to infer the direction of an eye movement, left or right, from the brain activation measured in the posterior parietal cortex. Without further training, the classifier then generalized to an arithmetic task. Its left versus right classification could be used to sort out subtraction versus addition trials, whether performed with symbols or with sets of dots. These findings are consistent with the suggestion that mental arithmetic co-opts parietal circuitry associated with spatial coding. 	2015-06-22T09:49:12.046564Z																				656								Science					2015-12-23T11:00:27.355223Z					Recruitment of an Area Involved in Eye Movements During Mental Arithmetic												470	schwarty	http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.1171599																							http://neurovault.org/collections/656/

is particularly unclear whether motor imagery relies on action-specific representations in premotor
and posterior parietal cortices. This study tackled this issue by attempting to decode the content of
motor imagery from spatial patterns of Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signals recorded in
the frontoparietal motor imagery network. During fMRI-scanning, 20 right-handed volunteers
worked on three experimental conditions and one baseline condition. In the experimental conditions,
they had to imagine three different types of right-hand actions: an aiming movement, an
extension–flexion movement, and a squeezing movement. The identity of imagined actions was
decoded from the spatial patterns of BOLD signals they evoked in premotor and posterior parietal
cortices using multivoxel pattern analysis. Results showed that the content of motor imagery (i.e.,
the action type) could be decoded significantly above chance level from the spatial patterns of
BOLD signals in both frontal (PMC, M1) and parietal areas (SPL, IPL, IPS). An exploratory searchlight
analysis revealed significant clusters motor- and motor-associated cortices, as well as in visual
cortices. Hence, the data provide evidence that patterns of activity within premotor and posterior
parietal cortex vary systematically with the specific type of hand action being imagined."	2015-11-18T09:16:19.189574Z																				953								Human Brain Mapping					2015-12-23T11:00:43.241273Z					Motor imagery of hand actions: Decoding the content of motor imagery from brain activity in frontal and parietal motor areas												740	Bastilinho	http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/hbm.23015																							http://neurovault.org/collections/953/

However, the localization of the brain regions under genetic influence during number manipulation is still unexplored. Here we investigated fMRI data from a group of 19 MZ (monozygotic) and 13 DZ (dizygotic) adult twin pairs, scanned during a mental calculation task. We examined both the activation and the degree of functional lateralization in regions of interest (ROIs) centered on the main activated peaks. Heritability was first investigated by comparing the respective MZ and DZ correlations. Then, genetic and environmental contributions were jointly estimated by fitting a ACE model classically used in twin studies. We found that a subset of the activated network was under genetic influence, encompassing the bilateral posterior superior parietal lobules (PSPL), the right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and a left superior frontal region. An additional region of the left inferior parietal cortex (IPC), whose deactivation correlated with a behavioral calculation score, also presented higher similarity between MZ than between DZ twins, thus offering a plausible physiological basis for the observable inheritance of math scores. Finally, the main impact of the shared environment was found in the lateralization of activation within the intraparietal sulcus. These maps of genetic and environmental contributions provide precise candidate phenotypes for further genetic association analyses, and illuminate how genetics and education shape the development of number processing networks.	2015-06-22T11:19:31.368509Z																				657								NeuroImage					2015-12-23T11:03:16.741917Z					Genetic and environmental contributions to brain activation during calculation												470	schwarty	http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1053811913004862																							http://neurovault.org/collections/657/

Prior neuroimaging studies have shown that why and how questions about actions differentially activate two cortical networks associated with mental-state reasoning and action representation, respectively; however, it remains unknown whether this is due to the differential demands of the questions per se or to the shifts in LOA those questions produce. We conducted functional MRI while participants judged pairs of action phrases that varied in LOA and that could be framed either as a why question (Why ride a bike? Get exercise.) or a how question (How to get exercise? Ride a bike.). Question framing (why vs. how) had no effect on activity in regions of the two networks. Instead, these regions uniquely tracked parametric variation in LOA, both across and within trials.

Smeets	unknown			mni	Food choices constitute a classic self-control dilemma involving the trade-off between immediate eating enjoyment and the long term goal of being slim and healthy, especially for weight-concerned women. For them, decision-making concerning high (HE) and low energy (LE) snacks differs when it comes to the need for self-control. In line, our first study aim was to investigate which brain regions are activated during food choices during HE compared to LE energy snacks in weight-concerned women. Since it is particularly difficult to resist HE snacks when they are very tasty, our second aim was to investigate in which brain regions choice-related activation varies with the food's tastiness. Our third aim was to assess in which brain regions choice-related activation varies with individual differences in self-regulatory success. To this end, 20 weight-concerned women indicated for 100 HE or LE snacks whether they wanted to eat them or not, while their brains were scanned using fMRI. HE snacks were refused more often than equally-liked LE snacks. HE snack choice elicited stronger activation in reward-related brain regions [medial to middle orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), caudate]. Highly tasty HE snacks were more difficult to resist and, accordingly, activation in inhibitory areas (inferior frontal gyrus, lateral OFC) was negatively associated with tastiness. More successful self-controllers showed increased activation in the supplementary motor area during HE food choices. In sum, the results suggest that HE snacks constitute a higher reward for weight-concerned women compared to (equally-liked) LE snacks, and that activation during food choice in brain regions involved in response inhibition varied with tastiness and individual differences in self-regulatory success.

Maintaining accurate beliefs in a changing environment requires dynamically adapting the rate at which one learns from new experiences. Beliefs should be stable in the face of noisy data, but malleable in periods of change or uncertainty. Here we used computational modeling, psychophysics and fMRI to show that adaptive learning is not a unitary phenomenon in the brain. Rather, it can be decomposed into three computationally and neuroanatomically distinct factors that were evident in human subjects performing a spatial-prediction task: (1) surprise-driven belief updating, related to BOLD activity in visual cortex; (2) uncertainty-driven belief updating, related to anterior prefrontal and parietal activity; and (3) reward-driven belief updating, a context-inappropriate behavioral tendency related to activity in ventral striatum. These distinct factors converged in a core system governing adaptive learning. This system, which included dorsomedial frontal cortex, responded to all three factors and predicted belief updating both across trials and across individuals.

Kable				mni	Abstract: Numerous experiments have recently sought to identify neural signals associated with the subjective value (SV) of choice alternatives. Theoretically, SV assessment is an intermediate computational step during decision making, in which alternatives are placed on a common scale to facilitate value-maximizing choice. Here we present a quantitative, coordinate-based meta-analysis of 206 published fMRI studies investigating neural correlates of SV. Our results identify two general patterns of SV-correlated brain responses. In one set of regions, both positive and negative effects of SV on BOLD are reported at above-chance rates across the literature. Areas exhibiting this pattern include anterior insula, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, dorsal and posterior striatum, and thalamus. The mixture of positive and negative effects potentially reflects an underlying U-shaped function, indicative of signal related to arousal or salience. In a second set of areas, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex and anterior ventral striatum, positive effects predominate. Positive effects in the latter regions are seen both when a decision is confronted and when an outcome is delivered, as well as for both monetary and primary rewards. These regions appear to constitute a “valuation system,” carrying a domain-general SV signal and potentially contributing to value-based decision making.	2015-12-15T01:41:52.370023Z								False												917								NeuroImage					2015-12-23T20:43:58.557897Z					The valuation system: A coordinate-based meta-analysis of BOLD fMRI experiments examining neural correlates of subjective value												278	jtmcguire	http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1053811913002188																							http://neurovault.org/collections/917/

Kleinschmidt			bthirion, gael.varoquaux		Both our environment and our behavior contain many spatiotemporal regularities. Preferential and differential tuning of neural populations to these regularities can be demonstrated by assessing rate dependence of neural responses evoked during continuous periodic stimulation. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure regional variations of temporal sensitivity along the human ventral visual stream. By alternating one face and one house stimulus, we combined sufficient low-level signal modulation with changes in semantic meaning and could therefore drive all tiers of visual cortex strongly enough to assess rate dependence. We found several dissociations between early visual cortex and middle- and higher-tier regions. First, there was a progressive slowing down of stimulation rates yielding peak responses along the ventral visual stream. This finding shows the width of temporal integration windows to increase at higher hierarchical levels. Next, for fixed rates, early but not higher visual cortex responses additionally depended on the length of stimulus exposure, which may indicate increased persistence of responses to short stimuli at higher hierarchical levels. Finally, attention, which was recruited by an incidental task, interacted with stimulation rate and shifted tuning peaks toward lower frequencies. Together, these findings quantify neural response properties that are likely to be operational during natural vision and that provide putative neurofunctional substrates of mechanisms that are relevant in several psychophysical phenomena as masking and the attentional blink. Moreover, they illustrate temporal constraints for translating the deployment of attention into enhanced neural responses and thereby account for lower limits of attentional dwell time.	2015-06-22T09:43:33.394635Z																				655								Journal of Neuroscience					2015-12-23T11:03:22.717873Z					Temporal Tuning Properties along the Human Ventral Visual Stream												470	schwarty	http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/doi/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2467-12.2012																							http://neurovault.org/collections/655/

Data were re-analyzed using Sleuth 2.3 in March 2015. In contrast to the analyses reported in our 2011 paper, here we incorporated peaks from throughout the brain, enabling a whole-brain analysis. One study (Lee et al 2007; BMapID 7080243) was retroactively dropped from the Brainmap database and was excluded from the negative affect  re-analysis. One error in the cognitive control database was corrected. Specifically, the y-coordinates for the 2 final peaks reported by Garavan et al 2002 (BMapID 30,348, exp=2) were flipped. Analyses were based on Sleuth work files that were manually re-generated in Spring 2015. The new work  files were carefully inspected to ensure that, with the 2 exceptions noted above, they exactly matched those detailed in our 2011 paper.
