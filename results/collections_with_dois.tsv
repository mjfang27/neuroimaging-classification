Margulies and Julia Sacher					Serotonin functions as an essential neuromodulator that serves a multitude of roles, most prominently balancing mood [ 1 ]. Serotonergic challenge has been observed to reduce intrinsic functional connectivity in brain regions implicated in mood regulation [ 2–4 ]. However, the full scope of serotonergic action on functional connectivity in the human brain has not been explored. Here, we show evidence that a single dose of a serotonin reuptake inhibitor dramatically alters functional connectivity throughout the whole brain in healthy subjects (n = 22). Our network-centrality analysis reveals a widespread decrease in connectivity in most cortical and subcortical areas. In the cerebellum and thalamus, however, we find localized increases. These rapid and brain-encompassing connectivity changes linked to acute serotonin transporter blockade suggest a key role for the serotonin transporter in the modulation of the functional macroscale connectome.	2014-10-29T06:39:16.336198Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/190/download								True												190				linear				Current Biology					2016-01-27T21:57:38.990273Z					Serotonergic Modulation of Intrinsic Functional Connectivity			1		2.0							140	alexschaefer83	http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982214010379							Siemens															other	http://neurovault.org/collections/190/				True

Eickhoff					We here investigated the core neural correlates of cognitive action control via coordinate-based meta-analyses of brain activity reported for the Stroop, spatial interference, stop-signal and go/no-go tasks. Our study revealed evidence for a pivotal role of the right anterior insula and right inferior frontal junction in supervisory attentional control, as these were the only two regions consistently involved in all four paradigm classes. Furthermore, the anterior midcingulate cortex and pre-supplementary motor area were commonly recruited by all but the go/no-go task.

Vogt, Karl Zilles and Simon B. Eickhoff					We here investigated posteriomedial (PMC) properties with a data-driven exploratory approach. First, we subdivided the PMC by whole-brain coactivation profiles. Second, functional connectivity of the ensuing PMC regions was compared by task-constrained meta-analytic coactivation mapping (MACM) and task-unconstrained resting-state correlations (RSFC). Third, PMC regions were functionally described by forward/reverse functional inference. We found four clusters, including a precuneal cluster, a ventral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) cluster, a dorsal PCC cluster, and a retrosplenial cluster. All PMC clusters were functionally coupled with the default mode network for task-unconstrained, but not task-constrained, connectivity.

We functionally characterized them in terms of functional connectivity and associated behavioral functions. This highlighted a cognitivo-motor gradient along the three subregions on the rostro-caudal axis: rostral, central and caudal. Furthermore, we identified a ventral subregion showing premotor eye-field functions and a dorsal one preferentially related to finder/hand movements.

Eickhoff					We used activation likelihood estimation (ALE) with all available and suitable PET and fMRI studies employing a vestibular stimulus. Most consistently across 28 experiments vestibular stimuli evoked activity in the right hemispheric parietal opercular area OP 2 implicating it as the core region for vestibular processing. A subsequent functional connectivity analysis, using these result as a seeding point, confirmed direct connections of OP 2 with every other region found in the meta-analysis, in particular temporo-parietal regions, premotor cortex, and the midcingulate gyrus. We conclude that the cytoarchitectonic area OP 2 in the parietal operculum, embedded in a joint vestibular network, should be the primary candidate for the human vestibular cortex.

To this end, a quantitative meta-analysis of pertinent neuroimaging studies was performed, identifying a set of mainly right-lateralized brain regions that may form the core network subserving vigilant attention in humans. This network included dorsomedial, mid- and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior insula, parietal areas (intraparietal sulcus, temporoparietal junction), and subcortical structures (cerebellar vermis, thalamus, putamen, midbrain).

A conjunction analysis across ALE meta-analyses delineating regions consistently recruited by reorienting of attention and false belief studies revealed the anterior rTPJ, suggesting an overarching role of this specific region. An anatomical difference analysis revealed the posterior rTPJ as converging more with false belief than with reorienting of attention tasks. Additional meta-analytic connectivity mapping (MACM) and resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analyses showed that the posterior rTPJ has connectivity patterns with typical ToM (Theory of Mind) regions, whereas the anterior part of rTPJ co-activates with the attentional network.

Mood-congruent biases in memory tasks are frequently reported in MDD patients, with facilitated memory for negative stimuli. Most functional MRI studies to date have examined the neural correlates of these biases in depressed adults, with fewer studies in adolescents with MDD. Investigation of MDD in adolescence may aid greater understanding of the aetiology and development of the disorder. 
Methods: Cognitive biases were investigated in 56 MDD patients aged 11-17 years and a matched group of 30 healthy control participants with a self-referential memory task. Behavioural performance and BOLD fMRI data were collected during both encoding and retrieval stages. 
Results: The neural response to encoding in adolescents with MDD was found to differ significantly from controls. Additionally, neural responses during encoding and retrieval showed differential relationships with age between patient and control groups, specifically in medial, temporal, and prefrontal regions. 
Conclusions: These findings suggest that during adolescence neurophysiological activity associated with emotional memory differs in those with depression compared to controls and may be age sensitive.

Forstmann and Jane Neumann					We conducted an Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analysis on the existing neuroimaging literature on perceptual decision making. The results argue in favor of the involvement of a frontal-parietal network in general perceptual decision-making that is possibly complemented by the basal ganglia, and modulated in substantial parts by task difficulty. In contrast, expectation of reward, an important aspect of many decision-making processes, shows almost no overlap with the general perceptual decision-making network.

Kable				mni	Abstract: Numerous experiments have recently sought to identify neural signals associated with the subjective value (SV) of choice alternatives. Theoretically, SV assessment is an intermediate computational step during decision making, in which alternatives are placed on a common scale to facilitate value-maximizing choice. Here we present a quantitative, coordinate-based meta-analysis of 206 published fMRI studies investigating neural correlates of SV. Our results identify two general patterns of SV-correlated brain responses. In one set of regions, both positive and negative effects of SV on BOLD are reported at above-chance rates across the literature. Areas exhibiting this pattern include anterior insula, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, dorsal and posterior striatum, and thalamus. The mixture of positive and negative effects potentially reflects an underlying U-shaped function, indicative of signal related to arousal or salience. In a second set of areas, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex and anterior ventral striatum, positive effects predominate. Positive effects in the latter regions are seen both when a decision is confronted and when an outcome is delivered, as well as for both monetary and primary rewards. These regions appear to constitute a “valuation system,” carrying a domain-general SV signal and potentially contributing to value-based decision making.	2015-12-15T01:41:52.370023Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/917/download								False												917								NeuroImage					2016-06-18T09:21:35.874124Z					The valuation system: A coordinate-based meta-analysis of BOLD fMRI experiments examining neural correlates of subjective value			64									278	jtmcguire	http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1053811913002188																							http://neurovault.org/collections/917/

In order to identify neural networks specifically involved in intentional action, freely chosen and externally cued intentions have previously been contrasted. This has led to the identification of a fronto-parietal network, which is involved in freely choosing one's intentions. However, it remains unclear whether this network encodes specific intentions, or whether it merely reflects general preparatory or control processes correlated with intentional action. Here, we used MVPA on fMRI data to identify brain regions encoding non-motor intentions that were either freely chosen or externally cued. We found that a fronto-parietal network, including the lateral prefrontal cortex, premotor, and parietal cortex, contained information about both freely chosen and externally cued intentions. Importantly, MVPA cross-classification indicated that this network represents the content of our intentions similarly, regardless of whether these intentions are freely chosen or externally cued. This finding suggests that the intention network has a general role in processing and representing intentions independent of their origin.	2016-05-09T10:46:17.082287Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/1359/download																	right			1359	Exclusion: history of neurological or psychiatric disorders, excess head movement during scanning (> 5 mm)							NeuroImage					2016-06-18T21:05:35.413446Z					Similar coding of freely chosen and externally cued intentions in a fronto-parietal network			4		4.0							1059	david	http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1053811916300842		0.31																					http://neurovault.org/collections/1359/

All subjects were skillful touch typists and performed five tasks: a typing task, a writing task, a reading task, and two control tasks. Three brain regions were activated during both the typing and the writing tasks: the left superior parietal lobule, the left supramarginal gyrus, and the left premotor cortex close to Exner’s area. Although typing and writing involved common brain regions, direct comparison between the typing and the writing task revealed greater left posteromedial intraparietal cortex activation in the typing task. In addition, activity in the left premotor cortex was more rostral in the typing task than in the writing task. These findings suggest that, although the brain circuits involved in Japanese typewriting are almost the same as those involved in handwriting, there are brain regions that are specific for typewriting.	2015-12-30T05:06:02.470846Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/1051/download	30.0	240.0	3.0	90.0				False			randommixedeffects						right			1051	Right-handed healthy volunteers who could touch type, and were native Japanese speakers with no history of neurological or learning disorderes.

Throughout combined, individual, and conjunction analyses on those two facial judgments, we observed consistent maxima in the amygdala which corroborates our initial hypothesis. This finding supports the contemporary paradigm shift extending the amygdala's role from dominantly processing negative emotional stimuli to processing socially relevant ones. Our data suggest that such a role includes not only ""fight-or-flight"" decisions but also social behaviors with longer term pay-off schedules, e.g., trustworthiness and attractiveness evaluation.

We performed meta-analytic connectivity modeling and resting-state analyses in the meta-analytically defined DMN regions, and obtained a a conjunction across both connectivity analyses. We then functionally characterized the ensuing regions and performed several cluster analyses.

Renken				mni	A key property of human visual behavior is the very frequent movement of our eyes to potentially relevant information in the environment. Observers thus continuously have to prioritize information for directing their eyes to. Research in this field has been hampered by a lack of appropriate measures and tools. Here, we propose and validate a novel measure of priority that takes advantage of the variability in the natural viewing behavior of individual observers. In short, our measure assumes that priority is low when observers' gaze behavior is inconsistent and high when it is very consistent. We calculated priority for gaze data obtained during an experiment in which participants viewed dynamic natural scenes while we simultaneously recorded their gaze position and brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Our priority measure shows only limited correlation with various saliency, surprise, and motion measures, indicating it is assessing a distinct property of visual behavior. Finally, we correlated our priority measure with the BOLD signal, thereby revealing activity in a select number of human occipital and parietal areas. This suggests the presence of a cortical network involved in computing and representing viewing priority. We conclude that our new analysis method allows for empirically establishing the priority of events in near-natural vision paradigms.	2016-06-20T08:30:30.829836Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/1467/download	28.0		3.0	70.0		True	SPM8 default	False	healthy subjects	RFX	randommixedeffects		t-test	SPM	False		right			1467			SPM8	linear				Journal of Vision					2016-06-20T08:30:30.830344Z					A novel measure to determine viewing priority and its neural correlates in the human brain			0						ascending	Realignment, Coregistration, Normalization, Smoothing		1125	marsman	http://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?doi=10.1167/16.6.3			EPI		1800.0	2.0	Philips	Intera				8.0		SPM	8					T1		eventrelated	http://neurovault.org/collections/1467/	False			False	True		False			False	True

Smeets				mni	Despite their intentions, weight-concerned individuals generally fail to control their eating behavior. However, it is unknown whether this failure is due to a lack of effortful self-control, or to not experiencing an internal conflict between weight goals and food temptations. The present study used fMRI, eye tracking and reaction times to assess the degree of conflict experienced by weight-concerned women during food choices that posed either a self-control dilemma (i.e., requiring a choice between healthy and palatable foods), or not. Contrary to the common assumption in self-control theory that food choices posing a self-control dilemma evoke internal conflict, we found that choices requiring self-control induced no conflict, as demonstrated by lower reaction times, fixation durations, number of gaze switches between snacks, and lower activation of the anterior cingulate cortex. Our results suggest that self-control failure might be due to a lack of experienced conflict, rather than to failing to act upon the perception of such conflict. This implies that effectiveness of weight maintenance interventions might be improved if they also focus on increasing the ability to detect a self-control dilemma, in addition to the current focus on increasing self-regulatory capacity.	2015-09-15T07:48:24.473327Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/724/download	3.8		3.0	70.0		True		False		REML	randommixedeffects		Factorial design: one sample t-test		False		right	CAnonical	128 s	724	Inclusion criteria: a restraint-score above average or high, age between 18 and 30 years, being right-handed, having a normal weight.

Such a protocol utilizes the fact that in humans the first half of the night is dominated by slow wave sleep, whereas during the second half, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is more predominant. Our data show that only REM-rich sleep during the second half of the night promoted good discrimination between fear-relevant and neutral stimuli during recall, while staying awake led to a recovery of discrimination between extinguished and neutral stimuli. This suggests that sleep following extinction contributes independently to successful extinction memory consolidation.	2016-02-22T23:11:08.299627Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/954/download	26.0	220.0	3.0	90.0		True		True	late night consolidation: sleep vs wake		randommixedeffects				False		right			954				nonlinear				Journal of Neuroscience			6	110.0	2016-06-14T15:38:38.471706Z			mean image		REM Sleep Is Causal to Successful Consolidation of Dangerous and Safety Stimuli and Reduces Return of Fear after Extinction	DARTEL to IXI Template		2	2.0	0.0	T1						741	MareikeM	http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/doi/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3083-15.2016	2	1.0	EPI		2.58		Siemens	TRIO	1.0	2.0				SPM	12		25.6			IXI Template as provided by VBM8 toolbox		eventrelated	http://neurovault.org/collections/954/	False			True	True		False

Dehaene			bthirion, gael.varoquaux		Linguistic analyses suggest that sentences are not mere strings of words but possess a hierarchical structure with constituents nested inside each other. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to search for the cerebral mechanisms of this theoretical construct. We hypothesized that the neural assembly that encodes a constituent grows with its size, which can be approximately indexed by the number of words it encompasses. We therefore searched for brain regions where activation increased parametrically with the size of linguistic constituents, in response to a visual stream always comprising 12 written words or pseudowords. The results isolated a network of left-hemispheric regions that could be dissociated into two major subsets. Inferior frontal and posterior temporal regions showed constituent size effects regardless of whether actual content words were present or were replaced by pseudowords (jabberwocky stimuli). This observation suggests that these areas operate autonomously of other language areas and can extract abstract syntactic frames based on function words and morphological information alone. On the other hand, regions in the temporal pole, anterior superior temporal sulcus and temporo-parietal junction showed constituent size effect only in the presence of lexico-semantic information, suggesting that they may encode semantic constituents. In several inferior frontal and superior temporal regions, activation was delayed in response to the largest constituent structures, suggesting that nested linguistic structures take increasingly longer time to be computed and that these delays can be measured with fMRI. 	2015-06-22T09:18:21.605851Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/654/download																				654								Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences					2016-02-29T09:06:36.251133Z					Cortical representation of the constituent structure of sentences			26									470	schwarty	http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1018711108																							http://neurovault.org/collections/654/

Prior neuroimaging studies have shown that why and how questions about actions differentially activate two cortical networks associated with mental-state reasoning and action representation, respectively; however, it remains unknown whether this is due to the differential demands of the questions per se or to the shifts in LOA those questions produce. We conducted functional MRI while participants judged pairs of action phrases that varied in LOA and that could be framed either as a why question (Why ride a bike? Get exercise.) or a how question (How to get exercise? Ride a bike.). Question framing (why vs. how) had no effect on activity in regions of the two networks. Instead, these regions uniquely tracked parametric variation in LOA, both across and within trials. This suggests that the human capacity to understand actions at different levels of abstraction is based in the relative activity of two cortical networks."	2015-07-06T01:51:20.845024Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/694/download								False									right			694	Participants were neurologically and psychiatrically healthy, had normal/corrected-to-normal vision, spoke English fluently, had IQ in the normal range (assessed with the Wechsler Abbreviated Scales o							Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience					2016-01-27T21:46:41.981587Z					The Neural Basis of Conceptualizing the Same Action at Different Levels of Abstraction			5		2.0							267	spunt	http://scan.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/doi/10.1093/scan/nsv084		0.65														46.0	29.47	21.0					http://neurovault.org/collections/694/

Partially distributed representations of objects and faces in ventral temporal cortex

Neural responses, as reflected in hemodynamic changes, were measured in six subjects (five female and one male) with gradient echo echoplanar imaging on a GE 3T scanner (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI) [repetition time (TR) = 2500 ms, 40 3.5-mm-thick sagittal images, field of view (FOV) = 24 cm, echo time (TE) = 30 ms, flip angle = 90] while they performed a one-back repetition detection task. High-resolution T1-weighted spoiled gradient recall (SPGR) images were obtained for each subject to provide detailed anatomy (124 1.2-mm-thick sagittal images, FOV = 24 cm). Stimuli were gray-scale images of faces, houses, cats, bottles, scissors, shoes, chairs, and nonsense patterns. The categories were chosen so that all stimuli from a given category would have the same base level name. The specific categories were selected to allow comparison with our previous studies (faces, houses, chairs, animals, and tools) or ongoing studies (shoes and bottles). Control nonsense patterns were phase-scrambled images of the intact objects. Twelve time series were obtained in each subject. Each time series began and ended with 12 s of rest and contained eight stimulus blocks of 24-s duration, one for each category, separated by 12-s intervals of rest. Stimuli were presented for 500 ms with an interstimulus interval of 1500 ms. Repetitions of meaningful stimuli were pictures of the same face or object photographed from different angles. Stimuli for each meaningful category were four images each of 12 different exemplars."	2015-03-05T20:12:11.044067Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/415/download					https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000105															415								NeuroImage					2016-03-10T18:10:06.054213Z					Combinatorial codes in ventral temporal lobe for object recognition: Haxby (2001) revisited: is there a “face” area?			14									186	vsochat	http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S105381190400299X					2.5		GE	3T															http://neurovault.org/collections/415/

Smeets	unknown			mni	Food choices constitute a classic self-control dilemma involving the trade-off between immediate eating enjoyment and the long term goal of being slim and healthy, especially for weight-concerned women. For them, decision-making concerning high (HE) and low energy (LE) snacks differs when it comes to the need for self-control. In line, our first study aim was to investigate which brain regions are activated during food choices during HE compared to LE energy snacks in weight-concerned women. Since it is particularly difficult to resist HE snacks when they are very tasty, our second aim was to investigate in which brain regions choice-related activation varies with the food's tastiness. Our third aim was to assess in which brain regions choice-related activation varies with individual differences in self-regulatory success. To this end, 20 weight-concerned women indicated for 100 HE or LE snacks whether they wanted to eat them or not, while their brains were scanned using fMRI. HE snacks were refused more often than equally-liked LE snacks. HE snack choice elicited stronger activation in reward-related brain regions [medial to middle orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), caudate]. Highly tasty HE snacks were more difficult to resist and, accordingly, activation in inhibitory areas (inferior frontal gyrus, lateral OFC) was negatively associated with tastiness. More successful self-controllers showed increased activation in the supplementary motor area during HE food choices. In sum, the results suggest that HE snacks constitute a higher reward for weight-concerned women compared to (equally-liked) LE snacks, and that activation during food choice in brain regions involved in response inhibition varied with tastiness and individual differences in self-regulatory success.

Schroeter, Jürgen Kratzsch and Arno Villringer				mni	The current study investigated neuropsychological and underlying structural and functional brain alterations in long-term adequately treated patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis in order to examine much discussed residual complaints in patients in relation to possible long-term neural alterations with a specific interest in the underlying autoimmune process. Eighteen patients with treated hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis (mean age 32, range 18-54 years; two males; mean treatment duration 4.4 years) and 18 healthy matched control subjects underwent 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Voxel-based morphometry was used to investigate grey matter density, resting-state functional MRI to analyse the brain connectivity of areas known to be altered in hypothyroidism and event-related functional MRI to examine brain activity during associative memory encoding. Neuropsychological assessment included memory, working memory, psychomotor speed and attention. We previously reported subclinically reduced mood in this study population and investigated its neural correlates here. Thyroid stimulating hormone, free triiodthyronine, free thyroxine and thyroid peroxidase antibodies were measured in serum. We did not find cognitive deficits or alterations in grey matter density, functional connectivity or associative memory-related brain activity in comparison to the control group and cognition was unrelated to thyroid serum measures in the patient group. Thyroid peroxidase antibodies in the patient group correlated with increased grey matter density in right amygdala and enhanced connectivity between subcallosal and parahippocampal areas. Treatment duration was associated with brain structure in frontal and occipital cortex and connectivity between left amygdala and frontal cortex. Mood correlated with brain areas associated with distinct functional networks, but not with those most prominently affected in depression. In conclusion, no cognitive or neural alterations were detected in this young and otherwise healthy cohort of patients in comparison to a healthy control group and current mood status could not be related to depression-related networks. However, autoimmune activity and treatment duration showed a relationship with depression and hypothyroidism-related brain structure and function. They are thus promising factors to further investigate residual complaints despite biochemically adequate treatment in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Given the small sample size, all findings require replication. 	2014-09-29T11:31:16.801612Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/145/download			3.0					True	Adequately treated patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (normal TSH) compared to thyroid healthy control group								both			145	Exclusion both groups: TSH outside reference range, for control group additionally: TPO antibody positive, patients additionally: dose change during study							Psychoneuroendocrinology					2016-01-27T21:48:00.232795Z					Structural and functional MRI study of the brain, cognition and mood in long-term adequately treated Hashimoto's thyroiditis			23		16.0							136	weig@cbs.mpg.de	http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306453014000407		6.0					Siemens	MAGNETOM Verio							SPM8	54.0	32.0	18.0					http://neurovault.org/collections/145/

It describes an additional study group from the study described here, Quinque et al. 2014: doi 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2014.01.015

Patients were newly diagnosed with hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis. 11 patients were recruited between June 2011 and June 2013 via local endocrinologists and among blood donors and participants of a large cohort study (LIFE). One patient had to be excluded due to a benign brain anomaly, another for a lack of hypothyroidism at study entry. Nine healthy control subjects were selected from the control sample of Quinque et al. 2014 to match the patients in age, sex and intelligence.
Sample description: mean age/SD patients 42+/-5, controls 38+/-8; 8 females each; IQ patients 104+/-10, controls 107+/-8. Thyroid laboratory values: patients session 1: TSH 6.1+/-1, fT3 4.8+/-1, fT4 12.6+/-2, TPO 285+/- 184; patients session 2: TSH 3.4+/-1, fT3 4.6+/-1, fT4 15.7+/-2, TPO 287+/-184; controls session 1: TSH 2.9+/- 1, fT3 4.5+/-1, fT4 14.9+/- 1, TPO 11+/-2; controls session 2: TSH 2.5+/- 1, fT3 4.4+/-0.4, fT4 14.5+/- 1, TPO 9+/-3.
The scanning protocol was identical to the one reported in Quinque et al. 2014. Analysis was identical except that data was not averaged over the two timepoints.
Groups were compared at both sessions separately. In addition, paired t-tests were used to analyse changes over time in the patient group. Thirdly, the interaction between session and group was analysed in a 2x2 ANOVA design. All analyses were controlled for age and sex, VBM analyses additionally for total intracranial volume (TIV).
Resting-state fMRI was only available for 8 patients, because one patient panicked after the structural scan. One control subjects was equally removed from the analysis to ensure matching between the groups.
The task fMRI data was not analysed due to an unexpected performance difference even before treatment in the direction that the patients performed better.
Overall conclusion: We were not able to find any group differences or changes over time that would survive classical statistical thresholds at the level of whole brain analyses or regions of interest analyses, (six ROIS as in Quinque et al. 2014 were used). As the sample was small and the disease severity and treatment effect on thyroid laboratory values likewise, we cannot conclude whether the result is due to a lack of power or whether there really are no structural and functional brain changes. Therefore, we refrain from publication, but want to make the data available for metaanalyses to avoid publication bias towards positive findings from little powered studies.

Eickhoff					In this study, we investigated the connectivity of the anterior and posterior parts of the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC). We estimated connectivity using three separate approaches: resting-state BOLD covariance, structural covariance based on cortical thickness, and meta-analytic connectivity modelling (MACM). We found a distinct overlap of all measures, more strongly for aLPFC, with working memory networks defined in a previous study, and a contrast between resting state aLPFC and pLPFC activation that is consistent with the idea of a hierarchical organization of frontoparietal networks. We also found significant anti-correlations of these seed region, with aLPFC but not pLPFC showing a substantial overlap with networks previously associated with social and emotional processing.

Ochsner			ChrisFiloGorgolewski, RussPoldrack		OpenfMRI ds000108. Although prefrontal cortex has been implicated in the cognitive regulation of emotion, the cortical-subcortical interactions that mediate this ability remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we identified a right ventrolateral prefrontal region (vlPFC) whose activity correlated with reduced negative emotional experience during cognitive reappraisal of aversive images. We then applied a pathway-mapping analysis on subcortical regions to locate mediators of the association between vlPFC activity and reappraisal success (i.e., reductions in reported emotion). Results identified two separable pathways that together explained approximately 50% of the reported variance in self-reported emotion: (1) a path through nucleus accumbens that predicted greater reappraisal success, and (2) a path through ventral amygdala that predicted reduced reappraisal success (i.e., more negative emotion). These results provide direct evidence that vlPFC is involved in both the generation and regulation of emotion through different subcortical pathways, suggesting a general role for this region in appraisal processes.	2015-03-06T01:22:46.836271Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/425/download			1.5		https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000108															425								Neuron					2016-01-27T21:48:06.955834Z					Prefrontal-Subcortical Pathways Mediating Successful Emotion Regulation			37									186	vsochat	http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0896627308007538		0.5					GE	Signa Twin Speed Excite HD scanner								41.0	22.18	18.0					http://neurovault.org/collections/425/

Group independent component analysis was used to estimate functional connectivity between visual and motor systems. We also ran group ICA on a subsample of data provided by the University of Michigan (UM_1) to the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange. We included all male subjects from UM_1 for whom DSM-IV-TR Diagnostic Category was provided, who met our criteria for motion, and whose images were successfully registered to standard space (N = 25). We then restricted the TD sample to balance the two diagnostic groups according to Full Scale IQ, age, handedness and between volume head movement. For each sample, there are 5 maps representing two motor components and three visual components. These unthresholded maps are the result of entering participant-specific motor and visual components from the corresponding sample into one-sample t-tests. 	2015-10-30T00:34:52.369804Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/693/download						True														693								Biological Psychiatry					2016-06-12T22:46:00.592880Z					Intrinsic visual-motor synchrony correlates with social deficits in autism			10	1.0								241	mb.nebel	http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006322315007283						2.0						6.0										other	http://neurovault.org/collections/693/				True	True					True	True

Vinski, Jonathan W. Schooler and Daniel S. Margulies					Reading is a fundamental human capacity and yet it can easily be derailed by the simple act of mind-wandering. A large-scale brain network, referred to as the default mode network (DMN), has been shown to be involved in both mind-wandering and reading, raising the question as to how the same neural system could be implicated in processes with both costs and benefits to narrative comprehension. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was used to explore whether the intrinsic functional connectivity of the two key midline hubs of the DMN — the posterior cingulate (PCC) and anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC) — was predictive of individual differences in reading comprehension and task focus recorded outside of the scanner. Worse comprehension was associated with greater functional connectivity between the PCC and a region of the ventral striatum. By contrast reports of increasing task focus were associated with functional connectivity from the aMPFC to clusters in the PCC, the left parietal and temporal cortex, and the cerebellum. Our results suggest that the DMN has both costs (such as poor comprehension) and benefits to reading (such as an on-task focus) because its midline core can couple its activity with other regions to form distinct functional communities that allow seemingly opposing mental states to occur. This flexible coupling allows the DMN to participate in cognitive states that complement the act of reading as well as others that do not.	2013-10-01T08:28:02.669405Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/18/download																				18								Frontiers in Human Neuroscience					2016-01-27T21:59:54.606772Z					The default modes of reading: modulation of posterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex connectivity associated with comprehension and task focus while reading			4									33	JonathanSmallwood	http://www.frontiersin.org/Human_Neuroscience/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00734/abstract																							http://neurovault.org/collections/18/

Adolphs					People typically explain others’ behaviors by attributing them to the beliefs and motives of an unobservable mind. Although such attributional inferences are critical for understanding the social world, it is unclear whether they rely on processes distinct from those used to understand the nonsocial world. In the present study, we used functional MRI to identify brain regions associated with making attributions about social and nonsocial situations. Attributions in both domains activated a common set of brain regions, and individual differences in the domain-specific recruitment of one of these regions—the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC)—correlated with attributional accuracy in each domain. Overall, however, the DMPFC showed greater activation for attributions about social than about nonsocial situations, and this selective response to the social domain was greatest in participants who reported the highest levels of social expertise. We conclude that folk explanations of behavior are an expert use of a domain-general cognitive ability.	2014-12-30T22:01:51.174588Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/297/download								False									right			297	neurologically and psychiatrically healthy, had normal or corrected-tonormal vision, spoke English fluently, had an IQ in the normal range							Psychological Science					2015-12-23T11:03:20.085190Z					Folk Explanations of Behavior: A Specialized Use of a Domain-General Mechanism			5		2.0							267	spunt	http://pss.sagepub.com/lookup/doi/10.1177/0956797615569002		0.3														46.0	28.32	21.0					http://neurovault.org/collections/297/

Both task-constrained meta-analytic coactivation mapping and task-free resting-state connectivity analysis independently identified two distinct clusters within RTPJ. Coactivation mapping and resting-state correlations revealed that the anterior cluster increased neural activity concomitantly with a midcingulate-motor-insular network, functionally associated with attention, and decreased neural activity concomitantly with a parietal network, functionally associated with social cognition and memory retrieval, while the posterior cluster showed the exact opposite association pattern.

The body underlies our sense of self, emotion, and agency. Signals arising from the skin convey warmth, social touch, and the physical characteristics of external stimuli. Surprising or unexpected tactile sensations can herald events of motivational salience, including imminent threats (e.g., an insect bite) and hedonic rewards (a caressing touch). Awareness of such events is thought to depend upon the hierarchical integration of body-related mismatch responses by the anterior insula. To investigate this possibility, we measured brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging, while healthy participants performed a roving tactile oddball task. Mass-univariate analysis demonstrated robust activations in limbic, somatosensory, and prefrontal cortical areas previously implicated in tactile deviancy, body awareness, and cognitive control. Dynamic Causal Modelling revealed that unexpected stimuli increased the strength of forward connections along a caudal to rostral hierarchy—projecting from thalamic and somatosensory regions towards insula, cingulate and prefrontal cortices. Within this ascending flow of sensory information, the AIC was the only region to show increased backwards connectivity to the somatosensory cortex, augmenting a reciprocal exchange of neuronal signals. Further, participants who rated stimulus changes as easier to detect showed stronger modulation of descending PFC to AIC connections by deviance. These results suggest that the AIC coordinates hierarchical processing of tactile prediction error. They are interpreted in support of an embodied predictive coding model where AIC mediated body awareness is involved in anchoring a global neuronal workspace.

In light of recent findings, the conflict monitoring hypothesis has been elaborated to an action-outcome predictor theory. One of the findings that led to this re-evaluation was the fMRI study in which conflict-related brain activity was investigated in terms of the so-called time on task effect, i.e., a linear increase of the BOLD signal with longer response times. The aim of this study was to investigate brain regions involved in the processing of saccadic response conflict and to account for the time on task effect. A modified spatial cueing task was implemented in the event-related fMRI study with oculomotor responses. The results revealed several brain regions which show higher activity for incongruent trials in comparison to the congruent ones, including pre-supplementary motor area together with the frontal and parietal regions. Further analysis accounting for the effect of response time provided evidence that these brain activations were not sensitive to time on task but reflected purely the congruency effect.	2016-02-23T18:10:28.051627Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/1212/download	60.0	220.0	1.5	90.0		True	align_epi_anat.py script computes the transforms needed to align EPI and anatomical datasets using a cost function designed for this purpose.

Hensel					In this study, the functional heterogeneity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) was investigated identifying four subregions (rostroventral, rostrodorsal, caudal-right, and caudal-left). Both rostral clusters were functionally connected to the amygdala and hippocampus and associated with mnemonic and social cognitive tasks. The rostroventral cluster exhibited strongest connectivity to the default mode network. Unlike the rostral differentiation, the caudal dmPFC was divided by hemispheres. The caudal-right cluster was strongly connected to a frontoparietal network (dorsal attention network), whereas the caudal-left cluster was strongly connected to the anterior midcingulate cortex and bilateral anterior insula (salience network).

A post-hoc functional characterization and functional connectivity analysis of these five clusters was then performed, revealing specific and distinct functional characteristics and connectivity patterns.

Lundström, Anna Andreasson, Martin Ingvar, Predrag Petrovic, John Axelsson and Gustav Nilsonne					Task-based fMRI has been used to study the effects of experimental inflammation on the human brain, but it remains unknown whether intrinsic connectivity in the brain at rest changes during a sickness response. Here, we investigated the effect of experimental inflammation on connectivity between areas relevant for monitoring of bodily states, motivation, and subjective symptoms of sickness. In a double-blind randomized controlled experiment, 52 healthy volunteers were injected with 0.6 ng/kg LPS (lipopolysaccharide) or placebo, and participated in a resting state fMRI experiment after approximately 2 h 45 min. Resting state fMRI data were available from 48 participants, of which 28 received LPS and 20 received placebo. Bilateral anterior and bilateral posterior insula sections were used as seed regions and connectivity with bilateral orbitofrontal and cingulate (anterior and middle) cortices was investigated. Back pain, headache and global sickness increased significantly after as compared to before LPS, while a non-significant trend was shown for increased nausea. Compared to placebo, LPS was followed by increased connectivity between left anterior insula and left midcingulate cortex. This connectivity was significantly correlated to increase in back pain after LPS and tended to be related to increased global sickness, but was not related to increased headache or nausea. LPS did not affect the connectivity from other insular seeds. In conclusion, the finding of increased functional connectivity between left anterior insula and middle cingulate cortex suggests a potential neurophysiological mechanism that can be further tested to understand the subjective feeling of malaise and discomfort during a sickness response.	2016-01-27T20:01:04.853843Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/807/download			3.0																	807								Brain, Behavior, and Immunity					2016-04-20T15:43:27.542880Z					Intrinsic functional connectivity of insular cortex and symptoms of sickness during acute experimental inflammation			8									548	gustav.nilsonne	http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0889159115300805																							http://neurovault.org/collections/807/

The self-report assessment and imaging data were collected as a part of the Nathan Kline Rockland Enhanced sample, which is a large-scale community sample of both phenotypic and neuroimaging data that is being openly shared as it is acquired. We decomposed NYC-Q scores using exploratory factor analysis and used these components to explore relationships between types of spontaneous thought and measures of intrinsic brain activity, specifically fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations, regional homogeneity, and degree centrality.	2013-09-05T09:18:10.000122Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/16/download																				16								PLoS ONE					2016-02-06T19:30:36.169067Z					A Correspondence between Individual Differences in the Brain's Intrinsic Functional Architecture and the Content and Form of Self-Generated Thoughts			30	1.0	3.0							1	ChrisFiloGorgolewski	http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0097176																60.0		18.0				other	http://neurovault.org/collections/16/

Dehaene			bthirion, gael.varoquaux		Throughout the history of mathematics, concepts of number and space have been tightly intertwined. We tested the hypothesis that cortical circuits for spatial attention contribute to mental arithmetic in humans. We trained a multivariate classifier algorithm to infer the direction of an eye movement, left or right, from the brain activation measured in the posterior parietal cortex. Without further training, the classifier then generalized to an arithmetic task. Its left versus right classification could be used to sort out subtraction versus addition trials, whether performed with symbols or with sets of dots. These findings are consistent with the suggestion that mental arithmetic co-opts parietal circuitry associated with spatial coding. 	2015-06-22T09:49:12.046564Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/656/download																				656								Science					2016-01-27T22:00:53.227193Z					Recruitment of an Area Involved in Eye Movements During Mental Arithmetic			34									470	schwarty	http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.1171599																							http://neurovault.org/collections/656/

Twenty-seven non-demented Parkinson's patients (mean disease duration: 5years, mean score on the Hoehn & Yahr scale=1.5) were compared with 26 elderly controls matched for age, sex, and education level. Track density images were created by sampling each subject's spatially normalized fiber tracks in 1mm isotropic intervals and counting the fibers that passed through each voxel. Whole-brain voxel-based analysis was performed and significance was assessed with permutation testing. Statistically significant increases in track density were found in the Parkinson's patients, relative to controls. Clusters were distributed in disease-relevant areas including motor, cognitive, and limbic networks. From the lower medulla to the diencephalon and striatum, clusters encompassed the known location of the locus coeruleus and pedunculopontine nucleus in the pons, and from the substantia nigra up to medial aspects of the posterior putamen, bilaterally. The results identified in brainstem and nigrostriatal pathways show a large overlap with the known distribution of neuropathological changes in non-demented PD patients. Our results also support an early involvement of limbic and cognitive networks in Parkinson's disease.	2014-08-24T10:24:43.378474Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/104/download	91.0	211.0	3.0			False		True	Parkinson's Disease vs. Healthy Controls				t-Test	TFCE			both			104		Linear	ANTs	nonlinear				NeuroImage				7744.0	2016-01-27T22:00:53.294497Z					Mapping track density changes in nigrostriatal and extranigral pathways in Parkinson's disease	Greedy symmetric diffeomorphic normalization (SyN)		2		10.0	Average pathlength map						106	swederik	http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1053811914005102	Twice-refocused spin-echo sequence with EPI readout at two distinct b-values (b=1000, b=2500 s/mm2) along 120 encoding gradients	0.53			6800.0	1.0	Siemens	Magnetom Allegra	0.0	2.4				Nipype	0.9	81.0	65.0	47.0	1.0	MNI152_T1_1mm_brain	Cross-correlation	other	http://neurovault.org/collections/104/				True							False

However, the localization of the brain regions under genetic influence during number manipulation is still unexplored. Here we investigated fMRI data from a group of 19 MZ (monozygotic) and 13 DZ (dizygotic) adult twin pairs, scanned during a mental calculation task. We examined both the activation and the degree of functional lateralization in regions of interest (ROIs) centered on the main activated peaks. Heritability was first investigated by comparing the respective MZ and DZ correlations. Then, genetic and environmental contributions were jointly estimated by fitting a ACE model classically used in twin studies. We found that a subset of the activated network was under genetic influence, encompassing the bilateral posterior superior parietal lobules (PSPL), the right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and a left superior frontal region. An additional region of the left inferior parietal cortex (IPC), whose deactivation correlated with a behavioral calculation score, also presented higher similarity between MZ than between DZ twins, thus offering a plausible physiological basis for the observable inheritance of math scores. Finally, the main impact of the shared environment was found in the lateralization of activation within the intraparietal sulcus. These maps of genetic and environmental contributions provide precise candidate phenotypes for further genetic association analyses, and illuminate how genetics and education shape the development of number processing networks.	2015-06-22T11:19:31.368509Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/657/download																				657								NeuroImage					2016-01-27T22:00:42.299581Z					Genetic and environmental contributions to brain activation during calculation			34									470	schwarty	http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1053811913004862																							http://neurovault.org/collections/657/

Endestad					The striking homogeneity of cerebellar microanatomy is strongly suggestive of a corresponding uniformity of function. Consequently, theoretical models of the cerebellum's role in motor control should offer important clues regarding cerebellar contributions to cognition. One such influential theory holds that the cerebellum encodes internal models, neural representations of the context-specific dynamic properties of an object, to facilitate predictive control when manipulating the object. The present study examined whether this theoretical construct can shed light on the contribution of the cerebellum to language processing. We reasoned that the cerebellum might perform a similar coordinative function when the context provided by the initial part of a sentence can be highly predictive of the end of the sentence. Using functional MRI in humans we tested two predictions derived from this hypothesis, building on previous neuroimaging studies of internal models in motor control. First, focal cerebellar activation–reflecting the operation of acquired internal models–should be enhanced when the linguistic context leads terminal words to be predictable. Second, more widespread activation should be observed when such predictions are violated, reflecting the processing of error signals that can be used to update internal models. Both predictions were confirmed, with predictability and prediction violations associated with increased blood oxygenation level-dependent signal in the posterior cerebellum (Crus I/II).

is particularly unclear whether motor imagery relies on action-specific representations in premotor
and posterior parietal cortices. This study tackled this issue by attempting to decode the content of
motor imagery from spatial patterns of Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signals recorded in
the frontoparietal motor imagery network. During fMRI-scanning, 20 right-handed volunteers
worked on three experimental conditions and one baseline condition. In the experimental conditions,
they had to imagine three different types of right-hand actions: an aiming movement, an
extension–flexion movement, and a squeezing movement. The identity of imagined actions was
decoded from the spatial patterns of BOLD signals they evoked in premotor and posterior parietal
cortices using multivoxel pattern analysis. Results showed that the content of motor imagery (i.e.,
the action type) could be decoded significantly above chance level from the spatial patterns of
BOLD signals in both frontal (PMC, M1) and parietal areas (SPL, IPL, IPS). An exploratory searchlight
analysis revealed significant clusters motor- and motor-associated cortices, as well as in visual
cortices. Hence, the data provide evidence that patterns of activity within premotor and posterior
parietal cortex vary systematically with the specific type of hand action being imagined."	2015-11-18T09:16:19.189574Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/953/download																				953								Human Brain Mapping					2016-01-27T21:47:52.642742Z					Motor imagery of hand actions: Decoding the content of motor imagery from brain activity in frontal and parietal motor areas			1									740	Bastilinho	http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/hbm.23015																							http://neurovault.org/collections/953/

Based on the voxel-based morphometry meta-analysis of 193 studies comprising 15 892 individuals across 6 diverse diagnostic groups (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, addiction, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and anxiety), we found that gray matter loss converged across diagnoses in 3 regions: the dorsal anterior cingulate, right insula, and left insula. By contrast, there were few diagnosis-specific effects, distinguishing only schizophrenia and depression from other diagnoses. In the parallel follow-up analyses of 3 healthy cohorts, we found that the common gray matter loss regions formed a tightly interconnected network during tasks and at resting and that lower gray matter in this network was associated with poor executive functioning.

Using this approach, connectivity-based parcellation divided the amygdala into three distinct clusters that are highly consistent with earlier microstructural distinctions. Meta-analytic connectivity modelling and functional characterization further revealed that the amygdala's laterobasal nuclei group was associated with coordinating high-level sensory input, whereas its centromedial nuclei group was linked to mediating attentional, vegetative, and motor responses.

Dehaene			bthirion, gael.varoquaux		Humans can understand spoken or written sentences presented at extremely fast rates of ∼400 wpm, far exceeding the normal speech rate (∼150 wpm). How does the brain cope with speeded language? And what processing bottlenecks eventually make language incomprehensible above a certain presentation rate? We used time-resolved fMRI to probe the brain responses to spoken and written sentences presented at five compression rates, ranging from intelligible (60–100% of the natural duration) to challenging (40%) and unintelligible (20%). The results show that cortical areas differ sharply in their activation speed and amplitude. In modality-specific sensory areas, activation varies linearly with stimulus duration. However, a large modality-independent left-hemispheric language network, including the inferior frontal gyrus (pars orbitalis and triangularis) and the superior temporal sulcus, shows a remarkably time-invariant response, followed by a sudden collapse for unintelligible stimuli. Finally, linear and nonlinear responses, reflecting a greater effort as compression increases, are seen at various prefrontal and parietal sites. We show that these profiles fit with a simple model according to which the higher stages of language processing operate at a fixed speed and thus impose a temporal bottleneck on sentence comprehension. At presentation rates faster than this internal processing speed, incoming words must be buffered, and intelligibility vanishes when buffer storage and retrieval operations are saturated. Based on their temporal and amplitude profiles, buffer regions can be identified with the left inferior frontal/anterior insula, precentral cortex, and mesial frontal cortex. 	2015-06-22T12:01:57.401977Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/659/download																				659								Journal of Neuroscience					2016-01-27T22:00:41.932197Z					A Temporal Bottleneck in the Language Comprehension Network			14									470	schwarty	http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/doi/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5685-11.2012																							http://neurovault.org/collections/659/

Maintaining accurate beliefs in a changing environment requires dynamically adapting the rate at which one learns from new experiences. Beliefs should be stable in the face of noisy data, but malleable in periods of change or uncertainty. Here we used computational modeling, psychophysics and fMRI to show that adaptive learning is not a unitary phenomenon in the brain. Rather, it can be decomposed into three computationally and neuroanatomically distinct factors that were evident in human subjects performing a spatial-prediction task: (1) surprise-driven belief updating, related to BOLD activity in visual cortex; (2) uncertainty-driven belief updating, related to anterior prefrontal and parietal activity; and (3) reward-driven belief updating, a context-inappropriate behavioral tendency related to activity in ventral striatum. These distinct factors converged in a core system governing adaptive learning. This system, which included dorsomedial frontal cortex, responded to all three factors and predicted belief updating both across trials and across individuals.

Coggan, Kirstie Wailes-Newson and Jonathan Smallwood			daniel.baker		Bistable stimuli, such as the Necker Cube, demonstrate that experience can change in the absence of changes in the environment. Such phenomena can be used to assess stimulus-independent aspects of conscious experience. The current study used resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to index stimulus-independent changes in neural activity to understand the neural architecture that determines dominance durations during bistable perception (using binocular rivalry and Necker cube stimuli). Anterior regions of the Superior Parietal Lobule (SPL) exhibited robust connectivity with regions of primary sensorimotor cortex. The strength of this region's connectivity with the striatum predicted shorter dominance durations during binocular rivalry, whereas its connectivity to pre-motor cortex predicted longer dominance durations for the Necker Cube. Posterior regions of the SPL, on the other hand, were coupled to associative cortex in the temporal and frontal lobes. The posterior SPL's connectivity to the temporal lobe predicted longer dominance during binocular rivalry. In conjunction with prior work, these data suggest that the anterior SPL contributes to perceptual rivalry through the inhibition of incongruent bottom up information, whereas the posterior SPL influences rivalry by supporting the current interpretation of a bistable stimulus. Our data suggests that the functional connectivity of the SPL with regions of sensory, motor, and associative cortex allows it to regulate the interpretation of the environment that forms the focus of conscious attention at a specific moment in time.	2015-08-06T08:49:19.524140Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/744/download	19.0	192.0	3.0	90.0	https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B5zqqbtBrnEHfmdzWkw2SlVNMkhtX0wwOEFsUUZqdU1IUUhFREU4c0xuNEhpR1d3aUt6MWc&usp=sharing			False												744								NeuroImage	420.0	420.0		64.0	2016-02-29T09:11:24.394071Z					Brain networks underlying bistable perception		1.0	7	1.0	5.0				interleaved			516	ddcoggan	http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1053811915005583					2000.0		General Electric	Signa Excite HDx		3.0												other	http://neurovault.org/collections/744/				True

Kleinschmidt			bthirion, gael.varoquaux		Both our environment and our behavior contain many spatiotemporal regularities. Preferential and differential tuning of neural populations to these regularities can be demonstrated by assessing rate dependence of neural responses evoked during continuous periodic stimulation. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure regional variations of temporal sensitivity along the human ventral visual stream. By alternating one face and one house stimulus, we combined sufficient low-level signal modulation with changes in semantic meaning and could therefore drive all tiers of visual cortex strongly enough to assess rate dependence. We found several dissociations between early visual cortex and middle- and higher-tier regions. First, there was a progressive slowing down of stimulation rates yielding peak responses along the ventral visual stream. This finding shows the width of temporal integration windows to increase at higher hierarchical levels. Next, for fixed rates, early but not higher visual cortex responses additionally depended on the length of stimulus exposure, which may indicate increased persistence of responses to short stimuli at higher hierarchical levels. Finally, attention, which was recruited by an incidental task, interacted with stimulation rate and shifted tuning peaks toward lower frequencies. Together, these findings quantify neural response properties that are likely to be operational during natural vision and that provide putative neurofunctional substrates of mechanisms that are relevant in several psychophysical phenomena as masking and the attentional blink. Moreover, they illustrate temporal constraints for translating the deployment of attention into enhanced neural responses and thereby account for lower limits of attentional dwell time.	2015-06-22T09:43:33.394635Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/655/download																				655								Journal of Neuroscience					2016-01-27T22:00:52.484670Z					Temporal Tuning Properties along the Human Ventral Visual Stream			75									470	schwarty	http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/doi/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2467-12.2012																							http://neurovault.org/collections/655/

Paper abstract: 
Valuation is a key tenet of decision neuroscience, where it is generally assumed that different attributes of competing options are assimilated into unitary values. Such values are central to current neural models of choice. By contrast, psychological studies emphasize complex interactions between choice and valuation. Principles of neuronal selection also suggest that competitive inhibition may occur in early valuation stages, before option selection. We found that behavior in multi-attribute choice is best explained by a model involving competition at multiple levels of representation. This hierarchical model also explains neural signals in human brain regions previously linked to valuation, including striatum, parietal and prefrontal cortex, where activity represents within-attribute competition, competition between attributes and option selection.

Although the insular cortex has been the topic of multiple parcellation studies, its functional specialization regarding taste processing received relatively little attention. Studies investigating the brain response to taste suggested that the insular cortex is involved in processing multiple characteristics of a taste stimulus, such as its quality, intensity, and pleasantness. In the current functional magnetic resonance study, younger and older adult male subjects were exposed to four basic tastes in five increasing concentrations. We applied a data-driven analysis to obtain insular response maps, which showed that the insular cortex processes the presence of taste, its corresponding pleasantness, as well as its concentration. More specifically, the left and right insular cortices are differentially engaged in processing the aforementioned taste characteristics: representations of the presence of a taste stimulus as well as its corresponding pleasantness dominate in the left insular cortex, whereas taste concentration processing dominates in the right insular cortex. These results were similar across both age groups. Our results fit well within previous cytoarchitectural studies and show insular lateralization in processing different aspects of taste stimuli in men. 	2015-08-11T12:21:36.391331Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/754/download	30.0		3.0	7.0		True	SPM8 native	False	Combination of healthy young and older male participants.		fixedeffects		regression	SPM8 native			right	HRF	128	754	No history of taste, smell, neurological, or psychological disorders.

The posterior subregion showed increased connectivity with bilateral intraparietal sulci, whereas the anterior subregion showed increased connectivity with the anterior cingulate cortex. Functional characterization revealed the anterior network to be more strongly associated with attention and action inhibition processes, whereas the posterior network was more strongly related to action execution and working memory.

Lieberman					Humans readily adopt an intentional stance to other people, comprehending their behavior as guided by unobservable mental states such as belief, desire, and intention. We used fMRI in healthy adults to test the hypothesis that this stance is primed by the default mode of human brain function present when the mind is at rest. We report three findings that support this hypothesis. First, brain regions activated by actively adopting an intentional rather than nonintentional stance to another person were anatomically similar to those demonstrating default responses to a fixation baseline condition. Second, moment-to-moment variation in default activity in the dorsomedial pFC was related to the ease with which participants applied an intentional-but not nonintentional-stance to a social stimulus presented moments later. Finally, individuals who showed stronger dorsomedial pFC activity at baseline in a separate task were generally more efficient when adopting the intentional stance and reported having greater social skills. These results identify a biological basis for the human tendency to adopt the intentional stance. More broadly, they suggest that the brain's default response may have evolved, in part, as a response to life in a social world.	2015-03-12T00:14:43.776034Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/446/download								False									right			446	All participants were native English speakers and were not taking psychotropic medications at the time of the study							Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience		590.0	4		2016-02-29T08:53:38.603509Z					The Default Mode of Human Brain Function Primes the Intentional Stance		3.0	6	2.0	0.0		True	https://github.com/spunt/easy-optimize-x				267	spunt	http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/jocn_a_00785		0.4762														31.0	22.86	18.0				eventrelated	http://neurovault.org/collections/446/

important for a variety of different cognitive control operations in visual attention
paradigms. However the synchronization source of these signals as defined by fMRI
BOLD activity and the extent to which theta oscillations play a role in multimodal
attention remains unknown. Here we investigated the extent to which cross-modal
visual and auditory attention impacts theta oscillations. Using a simultaneous EEGfMRI
paradigm, healthy human participants performed an attentional vigilance task with
six cross-modal conditions using naturalistic stimuli. To assess supramodal
mechanisms, modulation of theta oscillation amplitude for attention to either visual or
auditory stimuli was correlated with BOLD activity by conjunction analysis. Negative
correlation was localized to cortical regions associated with the default mode network
and positively with ventral premotor areas. Modality-associated attention to visual
stimuli was marked by a positive correlation of theta and BOLD activity in frontoparietal
area that was not observed in the auditory condition. A positive correlation of
theta and BOLD activity was observed in auditory cortex, while a negative correlation
of theta and BOLD activity was observed in visual cortex during auditory attention. The
data support a supramodal interaction of theta activity with of DMN function, and
modality-associated processes within fronto-parietal networks related to top-down
theta related cognitive control in cross-modal visual attention. On the other hand, in

Hansen					Belief–desire reasoning is a core component of ‘Theory of Mind’ (ToM), which can be used to explain and predict the behaviour of agents. Neuroimaging studies reliably identify a network of brain regions comprising a ‘standard’ network for ToM, including temporoparietal junction and medial prefrontal cortex. Whilst considerable experimental evidence suggests that executive control (EC) may support a functioning ToM, co-ordination of neural systems for ToM and EC is poorly understood. We report here use of a novel task in which psychologically relevant ToM parameters (true versus false belief; approach versus avoidance desire) were manipulated orthogonally. The valence of these parameters not only modulated brain activity in the ‘standard’ ToM network but also in EC regions. Varying the valence of both beliefs and desires recruits anterior cingulate cortex, suggesting a shared inhibitory component associated with negatively valenced mental state concepts. Varying the valence of beliefs additionally draws on ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, reflecting the need to inhibit self perspective. These data provide the first evidence that separate functional and neural systems for EC may be recruited in the service of different aspects of ToM.	2016-05-17T10:33:02.629084Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/1377/download																				1377								NeuroImage					2016-05-17T11:16:19.290281Z					Multiple roles for executive control in belief–desire reasoning: Distinct neural networks are recruited for self perspective inhibition and complexity of reasoning			3									1071	cehartwright	http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1053811912002844																							http://neurovault.org/collections/1377/

Wagner				mni	Many decisions require a context-dependent mapping from sensory evidence to action. The capacity for flexible information processing of this sort is thought to depend on a cognitive control system in frontoparietal cortex, but the costs and limitations of control entail that its engagement should be minimized. Here, we show that humans reduce demands on control by exploiting statistical structure in their environment. Using a context-dependent perceptual discrimination task and model-based analyses of behavioral and neuroimaging data, we found that predictions about task context facilitated decision making and that a quantitative measure of context prediction error accounted for graded engagement of the frontoparietal control network. Within this network, multivariate analyses further showed that context prediction error enhanced the representation of task context. These results indicate that decision making is adaptively tuned by experience to minimize costs while maintaining flexibility.	2016-05-03T05:55:58.946252Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/1070/download	30.0	192.0	3.0	77.0		True	Boundary-based registration	False									right			1070	N/A		ANTs	nonlinear				Cerebral Cortex		472.0	Variable	96.0	2016-05-03T05:56:08.294157Z					Adaptive Engagement of Cognitive Control in Context-Dependent Decision Making	Symmetric diffeomorphic	75.0	5	12.0	0.0	T1	False		interleaved			873	michael.l.waskom	http://www.cercor.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhv333	N/A	0.47	GRE-EPI		2.0	2.0	GE	Discovery 750	0.0	2.3		4.0	FSL SUSAN			29.0		19.0	2.0	FSL nonlinear MNI152		eventrelated	http://neurovault.org/collections/1070/				True							True

Knudsen and James Tonks					“Truth” has been used as a baseline condition in several functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of deception. However, like deception, telling the truth is an inherently social construct, which requires consideration of another person's mental state, a phenomenon known as Theory of Mind. Using a novel ecological paradigm, we examined blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses during social and simple truth telling. Participants (n = 27) were randomly divided into two competing teams. Post-competition, each participant was scanned while evaluating performances from in-group and out-group members. Participants were asked to be honest and were told that their evaluations would be made public. We found increased BOLD responses in the medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral anterior insula and precuneus when participants were asked to tell social truths compared to simple truths about another person. At the behavioral level, participants were slower at responding to social compared to simple questions about another person. These findings suggest that telling the truth is a nuanced cognitive operation that is dependent on the degree of mentalizing. Importantly, we show that the cortical regions engaged by truth telling show a distinct pattern when the task requires social reasoning.	2016-08-16T10:26:15.348706Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/1649/download																				1649								Frontiers in Human Neuroscience					2016-08-16T10:50:40.266736Z					Being asked to tell an unpleasant truth about another person activates anterior insula and medial prefrontal cortex			1									1231	martin@cfin.au.dk	http://journal.frontiersin.org/Article/10.3389/fnhum.2015.00553/abstract																							http://neurovault.org/collections/1649/

Hansen					The ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) has been implicated in studies of both executive and social functions. Recent meta-analyses suggest that vlPFC plays an important but little understood role in Theory of Mind (ToM). Converging neuropsychological and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) evidence suggests that this may reflect inhibition of self-perspective. The present study adapted an extensively published ToM localizer to evaluate the role of vlPFC in inhibition of self-perspective. The classic false belief, false photograph vignettes that comprise the localizer were modified to generate high and low salience of self-perspective. Using a factorial design, the present study identified a behavioural and neural cost associated with having a highly salient self-perspective that was incongruent with the representational content. Importantly, vlPFC only differentiated between high versus low salience of self-perspective when representing mental state content. No difference was identified for non-mental representation. This result suggests that different control processes are required to represent competing mental and non-mental content. 	2016-05-17T11:29:42.713359Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/1378/download																				1378								Neuropsychologia					2016-05-17T15:00:16.550325Z					The special case of self-perspective inhibition in mental, but not non-mental, representation			7									1071	cehartwright	http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0028393214004758																							http://neurovault.org/collections/1378/

Delgado	local AR(1) via FILM	SPM12		mni	The striatum serves as a critical brain region for reward processing. Yet, understanding the link between striatum and reward presents a challenge because rewards are composed of multiple properties. Notably, affective properties modulate emotion while informative properties help obtain future rewards. We approached this problem by emphasizing affective and informative reward properties within two independent guessing games. We found that both reward properties evoked activation within the nucleus accumbens, a subregion of the striatum. Striatal responses to informative, but not affective, reward properties predicted subsequent utilization of information for obtaining monetary reward. We hypothesized that activation of the striatum may be necessary but not sufficient to encode distinct reward properties. To investigate this possibility, we examined whether affective and informative reward properties were differentially encoded in corticostriatal interactions. Strikingly, we found that the striatum exhibited dissociable connectivity patterns with the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, with increasing connectivity for affective reward properties and decreasing connectivity for informative reward properties. Our results demonstrate that affective and informative reward properties are encoded via corticostriatal interactions. These findings highlight how corticostriatal systems contribute to reward processing, potentially advancing models linking striatal activation to behavior.	2016-05-31T03:38:01.144281Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/1408/download	30.0	204.0	3.0	90.0		True	normalized mutual information	False		GLS	randommixedeffects		regression	FSL	False		right	double gamma		1408			SPM12 (unified segmentation)	nonlinear	OLS	regression	FSL	Scientific Reports			variable	68.0	2016-06-19T16:10:20.074089Z					Distinct Reward Properties are Encoded via Corticostriatal Interactions		36.0	9	4.0	0.0		True	quasi-exponential distribution of ITIs/ISIs	interleaved			1089	david.v.smith	http://www.nature.com/articles/srep20093	GRAPPA (acceleration factor = 2)	0.4545	EPI		2.0	3.0	Siemens	trio	0.3	3.3		4.0	Gaussian	SPM12		39.0	33.0	18.0				eventrelated	http://neurovault.org/collections/1408/	True	False	True	True	True			False			True	False

Delgado					Much of the work in cognitive neuroscience is shifting from a focus on single brain regions to a focus on the connectivity between multiple brain regions. These inter-regional connectivity patterns contribute to a wide range of behaviors and are studied with models of functional integration. The rapid expansion of the literature on functional integration offers an opportunity to scrutinize the consistency and specificity of one of the most popular approaches for quantifying connectivity: psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis. We performed coordinate-based meta-analyses on 284 PPI studies, which allowed us to test (a) whether those studies consistently converge on similar target regions and (b) whether the identified target regions are specific to the chosen seed region and psychological context. Our analyses revealed two key results. First, we found that different types of PPI studies -- e.g., those using seeds such as amygdala and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and contexts such as emotion and cognitive control, respectively -- each consistently converge on similar target regions, thus supporting the reliability of PPI as a tool for studying functional integration. Second, we also found target regions that were specific to the chosen seed region and psychological context, indicating distinct patterns of brain connectivity. For example, the DLPFC seed reliably contributed to a posterior cingulate cortex target during cognitive control but contributed to an amygdala target in other contexts. Our results point to the robustness of PPI while highlighting common and distinct patterns of functional integration, potentially advancing models of brain connectivity.

Hansen					When required to represent a perspective that conflicts with one's own, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) suggests that the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (rvlPFC) supports the inhibition of that conflicting self-perspective. The present task dissociated inhibition of self-perspective from other executive control processes by contrasting belief reasoning—a cognitive state where the presence of conflicting perspectives was manipulated—with a conative desire state wherein no systematic conflict existed. Linear modeling was used to examine the effect of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) to rvlPFC on participants’ reaction times in belief and desire reasoning. It was anticipated that cTBS applied to rvlPFC would affect belief but not desire reasoning, by modulating activity in the Ventral Attention System (VAS). We further anticipated that this effect would be mediated by functional connectivity within this network, which was identified using resting state fMRI and an unbiased model-free approach. Simple reaction-time analysis failed to detect an effect of cTBS. However, by additionally modeling individual measures from within the stimulated network, the hypothesized effect of cTBS to belief (but, importantly, not desire) reasoning was demonstrated. Structural morphology within the stimulated region, rvlPFC, and right temporoparietal junction were demonstrated to underlie this effect. These data provide evidence that inconsistencies found with cTBS can be mediated by the composition of the functional network that is being stimulated. We suggest that the common claim that this network constitutes the VAS explains the effect of cTBS to this network on false belief reasoning.	2016-05-20T08:44:20.024012Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/1387/download																				1387								Human Brain Mapping					2016-05-20T08:47:44.755757Z					Resting state morphology predicts the effect of theta burst stimulation in false belief reasoning			1									1071	cehartwright	http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/hbm.23255																							http://neurovault.org/collections/1387/

Hansen					The medial pFC (mPFC) is frequently reported to play a central role in Theory of Mind (ToM). However, the contribution of this large cortical region in ToM is not well understood. Combining a novel behavioral task with fMRI, we sought to demonstrate functional divisions between dorsal and rostral mPFC. All conditions of the task required the representation of mental states (beliefs and desires). The level of demands on cognitive control (high vs. low) and the nature of the demands on reasoning (deductive vs. abductive) were varied orthogonally between conditions. Activation in dorsal mPFC was modulated by the need for control, whereas rostral mPFC was modulated by reasoning demands. These findings fit with previously suggested domain-general functions for different parts of mPFC and suggest that these functions are recruited selectively in the service of ToM. 	2016-05-17T15:03:56.530464Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/1379/download																				1379								Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience					2016-05-17T15:32:42.836272Z					Representation, Control, or Reasoning?

Fox, Simon B. Eickhoff, Chunshui Yu and Tianzi Jiang					The human brain atlases that allow correlating brain anatomy with psychological and cognitive functions are in transition from ex vivo histology-based printed atlases to digital brain maps providing multimodal in vivo information. Many current human brain atlases cover only specific structures, lack fine-grained parcellations, and fail to provide functionally important connectivity information. Using noninvasive multimodal neuroimaging techniques, we designed a connectivity-based parcellation framework that identifies the subdivisions of the entire human brain, revealing the in vivo connectivity architecture. The resulting human Brainnetome Atlas, with 210 cortical and 36 subcortical subregions, provides a fine-grained, cross-validated atlas and contains information on both anatomical and functional connections. Additionally, we further mapped the delineated structures to mental processes by reference to the BrainMap database. It thus provides an objective and stable starting point from which to explore the complex relationships between structure, connectivity, and function, and eventually improves understanding of how the human brain works. The human Brainnetome Atlas will be made freely available for download at http://atlas.brainnetome.org, so that whole brain parcellations, connections, and functional data will be readily available for researchers to use in their investigations into healthy and pathological states.	2016-08-10T05:29:01.925695Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/1625/download					http://atlas.brainnetome.org															1625								Cerebral Cortex					2016-08-10T05:43:48.352621Z					The Human Brainnetome Atlas: A New Brain Atlas Based on Connectional Architecture			9									194	lingzhong	http://www.cercor.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhw157																							http://neurovault.org/collections/1625/

Although the concept of fair allocation is one of the fundamental building blocks for societies, there is no clear consensus on how to achieve “socially just” allocations. Here we examine neuro-cognitive commonality of distributive judgments and risky decisions. We explore the hypothesis that people’s allocation decisions for others are closely related to economic decisions for self at behavioral, cognitive and neural levels, via a concern about the minimum, worst-off position. In a series of experiments using attention-monitoring and brain-imaging techniques, we investigated this “maximin” concern (maximizing the minimum possible payoff) via responses in two seemingly disparate tasks: third-party distribution of rewards for others, and choosing gambles for self. The experiments revealed three robust results: (1) participants’ distributive choices closely matched their risk preferences — “Rawlsians” who maximized the worst-off position in distributions for others avoided riskier gambles for themselves, while “utilitarians” who favored the largest-total distributions preferred riskier but more profitable gambles; (2) across individual choice-preferences, however, participants generally showed the greatest spontaneous attention to information about the worst possible outcomes in both tasks; and (3) such robust concerns about the minimum outcomes were correlated with activation of the right temporo-parietal junction (RTPJ), the region associated with perspective-taking. The results provide convergent evidence that social distribution for others is psychologically linked to risky decision-making for self, drawing on common cognitive-neural processes with spontaneous perspective-taking of the worst-off position.	2016-10-04T03:47:01.183587Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/1478/download	25.0	192.0	3.0	90.0		True												Canonical HRF	128 s	1478			SPM8	nonlinear			SPM	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences			variable	64.0	2016-10-04T03:47:20.352832Z			The first image of first session	SPM	Rawlsian maximin rule operates as a common cognitive anchor in distributive justice and risky decisions	VBM		4						interleaved	 Realign, slice timing correction, segmentation, normalization, and smoothing.		1137	pd.kamelab	http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1602641113	GRAPPA, 2		GRE EPI		2500.0	1.5	Siemens	Trio	0.0	3.0	SPM	6.0	Gaussian	SPM	8							hybridblockevent	http://neurovault.org/collections/1478/	False	False	True	True	True	False		False	False	True	True	False

We examined connectivity in three resting-state networks that link such executive functions with motor control: the Default Mode Network (DMN), the Fronto-Parietal Network (FPN), and the Motor Network (MN). We found two key patterns of significant between-group differences in connectivity that are consistent with the hypothesized cognitive demands of elite endurance running. First, enhanced connectivity between the FPN and brain regions often associated with working memory (left and right frontal cortex), suggest endurance running may stress executive functions in ways that increase connectivity in associated networks. Second, we found significant anti-correlations between the DMN and regions associated with motor control (right precentral area), somatosensory needs (right postcentral region), and visual association (occipital cortex).	2016-12-06T16:30:46.875412Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/1508/download	30.0	256.0	3.0	90.0				True	Young adult endurance athletes and age matched healthy non-athlete controls				2 sample T-test				both			1508								Frontiers in Human Neuroscience				64.0	2016-12-06T16:31:45.691806Z					Differences in Resting State Functional Connectivity between Young Adult Endurance Athletes and Healthy Controls			11						ascending	interframe motion correction & unwarping, slice-timing correction, coregistration, structural segmentation and normalization, functional normalization, motion outlier detection, functional smoothing		1156	DavidRaichlen	http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00610/full		1.0	gradient-echo planar imaging		2400.0		G.E.

Moodie and Russell A. Poldrack					Higher brain function relies upon the ability to flexibly integrate information across specialized communities of brain regions, however it is unclear how this mechanism manifests over time. In this study, we use time-resolved network analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data to demonstrate that the human brain traverses between two functional states that maximize either segregation into tight-knit communities or integration across otherwise disparate neural regions. The integrated state enables faster and more accurate performance on a cognitive task, and is associated with dilations in pupil diameter, suggesting that ascending neuromodulatory systems may govern the transition between these alternative modes of brain function. Together, our results confirm a direct link between cognitive performance and the dynamic reorganization of the network structure of the brain.	2016-10-24T22:51:26.577950Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/1941/download																				1941								Neuron					2016-10-26T15:39:46.366814Z					The Dynamics of Functional Brain Networks: Integrated Network States during Cognitive Task Performance			6									197	mac.shine	http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0896627316305773																						other	http://neurovault.org/collections/1941/

Gabrieli					Working memory is central to human cognition, and intensive cognitive training has been shown to expand working memory capacity in a given domain. It remains unknown, however, how the neural systems that support working memory are altered through intensive training to enable the expansion of working memory capacity. We used fMRI to measure plasticity in activations associated with complex working memory before and after 20 days of training. Healthy young adults were randomly assigned to train on either a dual n-back working memory task or a demanding visuospatial attention task. Training resulted in substantial and task-specific expansion of dual n-back abilities accompanied by changes in the relationship between working memory load and activation. Training differentially affected activations in two large-scale frontoparietal networks thought to underlie working memory: the executive control network and the dorsal attention network. Activations in both networks linearly scaled with working memory load before training, but training dissociated the role of the two networks and eliminated this relationship in the executive control network. Load-dependent functional connectivity both within and between these two networks increased following training, and the magnitudes of increased connectivity were positively correlated with improvements in task performance. These results provide insight into the adaptive neural systems that underlie large gains in working memory capacity through training.	2016-10-19T17:26:26.188410Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/1929/download																				1929								Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience					2016-10-19T17:26:26.189355Z					Intensive Working Memory Training Produces Functional Changes in Large-scale Frontoparietal Networks			0									873	michael.l.waskom	http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/jocn_a_00916																							http://neurovault.org/collections/1929/

While such attributions are often regarded as gratuitous anthropomorphisms and held apart from the attributions humans make about each other’s internal states, they may be the product of a general mechanism for flexibly interpreting adaptive behavior. To examine this, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans to compare the neural mechanisms associated with attributing emotions to humans and nonhuman animal behavior. While undergoing fMRI, participants first passively observed the facial displays of human, nonhuman primate, and domestic dogs, and subsequently judged the acceptability of emotional (e.g., ""annoyed"") and facial descriptions (e.g., ""baring teeth"") for the same images. For all targets, emotion attributions selectively activated regions in prefrontal and anterior temporal cortices associated with causal explanation in prior studies. These regions were similarly activated by both human and nonhuman targets even during the passive observation task; moreover, the degree of neural similarity was dependent on participants’ self-reported beliefs in the mental capacities of nonhuman animals. These results encourage a non-anthropocentric view of emotion understanding, one that treats the idea that animals have emotions as no more gratuitous than the idea that humans other than ourselves do."	2016-11-03T22:12:34.794696Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/1846/download																				1846								Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience					2016-11-04T17:34:19.567496Z					The Neural Basis of Understanding the Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals			12									267	spunt	http://scan.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/doi/10.1093/scan/nsw161																							http://neurovault.org/collections/1846/

Bernhardt, Jonathan Smallwood and Elizabeth Jefferies				mni	This study focussed on understanding the functional contribution of pMTG to semantic control and event/relational semantics: we explored the hypothesis that this region acts to integrate information from the MDN and also the DMN, which are anti-correlated at rest. First, we identified whether there are regions of pMTG that show a common response to the retrieval of action features (contrasted with colour feature judgements which have not been historically linked to pMTG; Badre et al., 2005) and global associations (relative to feature judgements). Both of these event/relational contrasts depend on retrieving information in line with a specific stimulus-driven context, as opposed to the application of a specific goal specified in the instructions. We compared the location of this response to regions implicated in semantic control and domain-general control in previous meta-analyses.	2016-06-02T18:06:55.167507Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/1265/download	30.0	192.0	3.0	90.0		True											right			1265			FSL	linear				NeuroImage		720.0		64.0	2016-06-02T18:07:36.565802Z				McFlirt	Exploring the role of the posterior middle temporal gyrus in semantic cognition: Integration of anterior temporal lobe with executive processes		36.0	10	2.0	2.0				interleaved			701	james.davey	http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1053811916301719			single-shot 2D gradient-echo echo planar imaging (EPI) flip angle = 90°, matrix size = 64 x 64, FOV 192 x 192 mm2, (TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, 32 slices, voxel size = 3 x 3 x 4.5 mm3		2000.0		GE	HDx Excite		3.0		5.0	5mm spatial smoothing	FSL	4.1.9							eventrelated	http://neurovault.org/collections/1265/	False			True	True					False	True

However, the mechanisms through which maternal exercise might promote such effects are not well understood. The present study examined levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and absolute cell num- bers in the hippocampal formation and cerebral cortex of rat pups born from mothers exer- cised during pregnancy. Additionally, we evaluated the cognitive abilities of adult offspring in different behavioral paradigms (exploratory activity and habituation in open field tests, spatial memory in a water maze test, and aversive memory in a step-down inhibitory avoid- ance task). Results showed that maternal exercise during pregnancy increased BDNF lev- els and absolute numbers of neuronal and non-neuronal cells in the hippocampal formation of offspring. No differences in BDNF levels or cell numbers were detected in the cerebral cortex. It was also observed that offspring from exercised mothers exhibited better cognitive performance in nonassociative (habituation) and associative (spatial learning) mnemonic tasks than did offspring from sedentary mothers. Our findings indicate that maternal exer- cise during pregnancy enhances offspring cognitive function (habituation behavior and spa- tial learning) and increases BDNF levels and cell numbers in the hippocampal formation of offspring.

M. van Zijl and James J. Pekar					"We have acquired a longitudinal single-subject dataset of a healthy volunteer (40 years of age at time of initial scan; male). A total of 158 sessions of MRI data was acquired on a weekly basis, over a span of 185 weeks (a little over 3 years). 

The subject was scanned on a 3T Philips Achieva scanner (Philips HealthCare, Best, Netherlands). Rs-fMRI data of the subject was acquired using a multi-slice SENSE-EPI pulse sequence  with TR/TE = 2000/30 ms, SENSE factor = 2, flip angle = 75°, 37 axial slices, nominal resolution = 3x3x3 mm3, 1 mm gap, 16 channel neuro-vascular coil, number of dynamics (frames) per run = 200. The rs-fMRI scans were always acquired after the T1w scans, to allow participants to get acclimated to the noise and environment inside the scanner. The subject was instructed to stay as still as possible with his eyes closed during the entire scan, and no other instruction was provided.

This is intended to be a resource for statisticians and imaging scientists to be able to quantify the intra-subject inter-session reproducibility of their image analysis methods using data available from a generic 7 min session at 3T. The full dataset is available through NITRC. Here, the resulting aggregate maps from the independent component analysis (ICA) are uploaded.

Finally, we calculated the functional connectivity between time-series from the networks for adolescent sample, and correlated the connectivity value with substance-use-information of adolescent. We found that the the lowered connectivity between the networks has relationship significantly with increased self-control and less use of substance-use. 	2016-08-12T15:44:27.393508Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/1637/download																				1637								Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience					2016-08-12T20:29:34.430332Z					Negative functional coupling between the right fronto-parietal and limbic resting state networks predicts increased self-control and later substance use onset in adolescence			6									1220	taehol	http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1878929316300172																							http://neurovault.org/collections/1637/

Ivry and Tor Endestad					Functional neuroimaging studies consistently report language-related cerebellar activations, but evidence from the clinical literature is less conclusive. Here, we attempt to bridge this gap by testing the effect of focal cerebellar lesions on cerebral activations in a reading task previously shown to involve distinct cerebellar regions. In a previous fMRI-study of healthy young adults, we observed increased activation in the posterior cerebellum when the final word of a sentence was predictable, compared to when the final word was unpredictable; this effect was especially strong when the prediction was violated. In addition, an experimental contrast designed to function as a basic language localizer revealed activations in more medial cerebellar regions. All contrasts also yielded distributed cerebral activations. In the current study, patients (N=10) had lesions primarily affecting midline cerebellar structures, overlapping cerebellar activations previously seen for basic language processing, but distinct from prediction-related activations. In line with this pattern of cerebellar activation-lesion overlap, the patients did not differ from matched healthy controls (N=10) in cerebral activations related to prediction generation or prediction error processing. However, they exhibited a different cerebral activation pattern related to general language processing. Whereas controls showed increased activation in bilateral auditory cortex and parietal operculum when silently reading familiar words relative to viewing meaningless and unpronounceable letter strings, this effect was absent in the patients. Our results highlight the need for careful lesion mapping when investigating functional consequences of cerebellar pathology and suggest possible roles for the cerebellum in visual-to-auditory mapping and/or inner speech.	2015-10-30T00:18:50.339407Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/160/download																				160								Brain and Language					2016-06-12T22:17:13.283152Z					Patients with focal cerebellar lesions show reduced auditory cortex activation during silent reading			11									40	tmoberget	http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0093934X15001753																							http://neurovault.org/collections/160/

Spunt and Ralph Adolphs					The ability to impute mental states to others, or Theory of Mind (ToM), has been the subject of hundreds of neuroimaging studies. Although reviews and meta-analyses of these studies have concluded that ToM recruits a coherent brain network, mounting evidence suggests that this network is an abstraction based on pooling data from numerous studies, most of which use different behavioral tasks to investigate ToM. Problematically, this means that no single behavioral task can be used to reliably measure ToM Network function as currently conceived. To make ToM Network function scientifically tractable, we need standardized tasks capable of reliably measuring specific aspects of its functioning. Here, our goal is to validate the Why/How Task for this purpose. Several prior studies have found that when compared to answering how-questions about another person's behavior, answering why-questions about that same behavior activates a network that is anatomically consistent with meta-analytic definitions of the ToM Network. In the version of the Why/How Task presented here, participants answer yes/no Why (e.g., Is the person helping someone?) and How (e.g., Is the person lifting something?) questions about pretested photographs of naturalistic human behaviors. Across three fMRI studies, we show that the task elicits reliable performance measurements and modulates a left-lateralized network that is consistently localized across studies. While this network is convergent with meta-analyses of ToM studies, it is largely distinct from the network identified by the widely used False-Belief Localizer, the most common ToM task. Our new task is publicly available, and can be used as an efficient functional localizer to provide reliable identification of single-subject responses in most regions of the network. Our results validate the Why/How Task, both as a standardized protocol capable of producing maximally comparable data across studies, and as a flexible foundation for programmatic research on the neurobiological foundations of a basic manifestation of human ToM.	2015-03-11T19:00:17.646736Z	http://neurovault.org/collections/445/download																				445								NeuroImage					2016-06-12T23:01:05.078767Z					Validating the Why/How contrast for functional MRI studies of Theory of Mind			5									267	spunt	http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1053811914003887																							http://neurovault.org/collections/445/

To further elucidate neural underpinnings of BPD, the present meta-analysis summarizes functional neuroimaging findings of emotion processing tasks as well as structural neuroimaging findings, and investigates multi-modally affected brain regions.Combined coordinate- and image-based meta-analyses were calculated using Anisotropic Effect Size Signed Differential Mapping. Nineteen functional neuroimaging studies investigating the processing of negative compared to neutral stimuli in a total of 281 patients with BPD and 293 healthy controls were included. In addition, ten nine studies investigating gray matter abnormalities in 263 256 patients with BPD and 278 272 healthy (HC) controls were analyzed. Compared to HC, BPD patients showed relatively increased activation of the left amygdala and posterior cingulate cortex, along with blunted responses of the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during the processing of negative emotional stimuli. The multi-modal analysis identified the left amygdala to be characterized by a combination of functional hyperactivity and smaller gray matter volume compared to HC. Hyperresponsivity of the amygdala was moderated by medication status of the patient samples. Medication-free samples were characterized by limbic hyperactivity, whereas no such group differences were found in patients currently taking psychotropic medication. Results strengthen the assumption that dysfunctional dorsolateral prefrontal and limbic brain regions are a hallmark feature of BPD, and therefore are consistent with the conceptualization of BPD as an emotion dysregulation disorder.
